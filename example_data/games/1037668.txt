1. e4 { Notes by Raymond Keene. } c6 2. Nc3 {I had expected 2
d4 d5 3 e5!? Bf5 4 Nc3, e.g. 4...e6 5 g4 Bg6 6 Nge2 Bb4 7 h4
Be4 8 Rh3 h5 9 Ng3 c5 10 Bg5 Qb6 as in Day - Vranesic,
Canadian Championship 1981; here Day himself in BCO gives 11
a3! 'better for White'. Therefore I wanted to try 4...Qb6!? 5
g4 Bd7 6 Na4 Qc7 7 Nc5 e6 8 Nxd7. Velimirovic - Kasparov,
Moscow Interzonal 1982, proceeded with 8...Nxd7. My new idea
was 8...Qxd7 intending a quick ...c6-c5 in conjunction with
...Nc6. The black Ng8 can go to e7 to hold up White's thematic
plan of f2-f4-f5 which caused Kasparov trouble in his game.}
2...d5 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 Nf6 6. b3 {!? This must
be a novelty, though it's quite in Day's inventive style. I
anticipated White to follow up with O-O-O and then g4, h4, g5,
h5, trying to mince my kingside in cO-Operation with the Bb2.}
6...e6 7. Bb2 Nbd7 8. exd5 {? From now on White starts to play
feebly. He should maintain the tension with 8 O-O-O, although
8...Bb4 is satisfactory for Black.} 8...cxd5 9. Qg3 {With
threats of Nb5, also trying to impede the development of
Black's dark-squared bishop. A broadly similar concept was
seen in Smyslov - Botvinnik (first match game, World
Championship 1958), which duplicated this game for the first
five moves and then varied with 6 d3 e6 7 Be2 Nbd7 8 Qg3, but
Botvinnik proved that 8...g6! is possible, even with ...e7-e6
already played. Black developed the Bf8 on g7 and went on to
win. So in this game I always had ...g7-g6 in mind as a
reserve development.} 9...a6 10. O-O-O Rc8 11. d4 {? A losing
positional blunder which weakens c3 and blocks his
dark-squared bishop. Perhaps White was bothered by distant
threats of ...d5-d4 from Black. Anyway, 11 Re1 is superior.}
11...Qa5 {Black swiftly works up an annihilating initiative.}
12. Kb1 Ba3 13. Ba1 Bb4 14. Rd3 {Of course 14 Qxg7 loses a
piece to 14...Rg8.} 14...O-O 15. Qe3 {The threat was 15...Bxc3
and 16...Ne4.} 15...Rc6 16. Nd1 Ne4 {Also tempting but
complicated is 16...Rxc2 17 Kxc2 Qxa2+ 18 Bb2 Rc8+ 19 Rc3!
Bxc3 20 Nxc3 Ne4 21 Bc4! Nxc3 22 Ra1 Nd1!} 17. c3 Be7 18. h4
b5 {The rest is automatic. White's queenside pawns are
structurally dead, and Black enjoys the luxury of having the
white king as an additional target.} 19. b4 Qc7 20. f4 {I
didn't understand this, but it is too late to make any
difference.} 20...Rc8 21. Bb2 Nb6 22. Rh3 Nc4 23. Qe1 {A
series of brutal sacrifices now forces mate.} 23...Bxb4
24. cxb4 Na3+ 25. Bxa3 Rc1+ 0-1
