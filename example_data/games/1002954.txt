23. Re4 Kg8 24. Rfe1 Re7 {White's position is superior;
firstly, because the only open file on the board is his, and
secondly, because the Black Queen's side pawns are advanced,
and therefore weak for a King's ending. After exchanging the
Queen and one Rook, the possession of the King's file ensures
the advance of the King to K4 and from there to Q5. Then the
weakness of Black's pawns decides the game.} 25. Qxd7 Rxd7
26. Re8+ Rxe8 27.Rxe8+ Kh7 28. Kh2 g6 29. Kg3 {PxP is no
threat, because White wins the pawn back at once with R-K5. By
capturing, Black would only dislocate his pawns.} Kg7 30. Kf4
Kf6 31. Re5 b6 32. Ke4 Rd6 33. f4 Re6 { Black probably hopes
for a counter chance by getting a distant passed pawn on the
K-Rook's file. But he underrates the weakness of the Queen's
side pawns, and even without the exchange of Rooks, White
would win, by settling the King's side first and then tearing
up the Queen's side, as in the game: 34. P-KKt4, R- K2;
35. PxP, PxP; 36. P-Kt5ch, PxP; 37. PxPch.} 34. hxg6 fxg6
35. Kd5 Rxe5+ 36. fxe5+ Ke7 37. b4 { Black must capture, as he
needs seven moves in which to exchange the Knight's pawn and
queen his Rook's pawn, whilst in that time White can win the
QP after PxP, and yet arrive in time with his King to stop the
pawn from queening. After 37. ... PxP, however, there follows
38. KxP. Then White covers his passed pawn with P-Q4, and his
King, having full freedom, captures all the Black pawns.} 1-0
