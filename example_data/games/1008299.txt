5. a4 Bf5 6. e3 e6 7. Bxc4 Bb4 8. O-O O-O 9. Ne5 {If White
hopes to get an advantage with this move, in conjunction with
the following, he was mistaken. But also 9 Qe2 Ne4 (not ...c5
10 Na2 Ba5 11 dxc5 Nc6 12 Rd1 Qe7 13 Nd4 Rfd8 14 B4!, as in
Ragozin-Flohr, Moscow, 1936.) 10 Nxe4 Bxe4 11 Rd1 Nd7 as in
the sixth round game Lasker-Capablanca, seems to give white no
appreciable pull.} c5 {! This move had to be very carefully
calculated (or analysed beforehand) as it involves a temporary
pawn sacrifice.} 10. Na2 Ba5 {To allow this bishop to be
exchanged would give White without a fight a distinct
positional advantage.} 11. dxc5 Qxd1 12. Rxd1 Bc2 {! The chief
point of the defence, which enables Black to gain soon an
important tempo in development.} 13. Rd4 {After 13 Rf1 Bc7
with Bxa4 to follow, black would be very well suited.} Bc7
14. Nf3 {14 f4 Bxe5 15 fxe5 Nfd7 16 Nb4 Bg6 would yield White
no profit.} Nc6 15. Rd2 {The rook must keep on the center
file. If 15 Rh4 Rad8 16 Bd2? g5.} Bg6 {Black's minor pieces
are now very harmoniously posted, and the recovery of the pawn
can only be a question of very little time.} 16. b4 {To meet
the threat of Ne4.} a5 {!} 17. b5 Ne5 18. Nxe5 {White takes
the eariest opportunity of a drawish ending.} Bxe5 19. Bb2 Ne4
20. Re2 Bxb2 21. Rxb2 Nxc5 22. Nc1 {Black's positional
advantage is only apparent, and would soon disappear after
22...Rfd8 23 Nb3 Nxb3 24 Bxb3, etc.} 1/2-1/2
