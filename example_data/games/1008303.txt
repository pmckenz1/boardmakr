1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5
5. Bd3 {This seems to promise even less winning chances than
the more usual 5 cxd5 after which Black gets a satisfactory
position by the manouver ... Qc8 and eventually ...Nfd7} e6
6. cxd5 {If first 6 Bxf5 exf5 and then 7 cxd5, Black would
reply Nxd5.} Bxd3 7. Qxd3 exd5 {The position now reached is
familiar with colors reversed, in a variation of the Caro Kann
Defence (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c3) in which Black - as
in this case White - has to choose between a "minority attack"
on the Q side or a break in the center by e4. Dr. Lasker
selects the second method, which gives him, however, only
prospects for a draw.} 8. Nc3 Bd6 9. O-O O-O 10. Re1 Nbd7
{White's next move could not be prevented.} 11. e4 dxe4
12. Nxe4 Nxe4 13. Qxe4 {This looks like a drawing proposition,
as after Black's next move further liquidation will be
practically forced. But White had no objective reason to avoid
a draw, as the alternative 13 Rxe4 Qf6 would now offer him
attacking chances.} Re8 14. Qxe8+ Qxe8 15. Rxe8+ Rxe8 16. Kf1
{At this moment the game might safely be declared a draw;
certainly with more reason that many other games in this
tournament. That the draw was not declared here was only, I
presume, because neither player offered one, for different
reasons. Dr. Lasker, because (although he doubtless was
perfectly aware that his isolated pawn is by no means a
serious weakness) he was, theoretically at least, at a slight
disadvantage; Dr. Euwe because as the new champion he felt
obliged to exploit even the shade of a winning chance. The
unfortunate result was the ending catastrophe, which changed
the normal course of the tournament.} Nb6 17. Bd2 f6 18. Re1
Rxe1+ 19. Nxe1 Kf7 20. Ke2 Ke6 21. h3 Nc4 22. Bc1 Bc7 23. Kd3
Ba5 {?? This move is hard indeed to understand, as even the
answers 24 Nc2 or 24 Kxc4 Be1 25 Be3 would yield Black no
advantage.} 24. b4 {! The rest of the game requires no
comment.} Bxb4 25. Nc2 Bd2 26. Bxd2 Nb2+ 27. Ke3 Kd5 28. Bc1
