1.e4 {Notes by Lasker.} e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3 Bb4 4.Bg2 d6 5.d3 d5
6.exd5 Nxd5 7.Bd2 c6 {In positions of this kind it is
preferable to guard the pawn by Be6; the square c6 should be
reserved for the Knight. White ofcourse has no intention of
exchanging his B at g2; but Black wishes to compel him to do
so; therefore the Kt at d5 and B at e6 are well posted.}
8.Nge2 O-O 9.O-O Bc5 10.Kh1 Bg4 11.Qe1 Nxc3 12.Nxc3 Nd7 13.Ne4
Be7 14.f4 exf4 15.Bxf4 Nf6 16.Nxf6+ {This brings black's KB on
a very unfavorable diagonal. Instead, he should have occupied
this diagonal himself by Be5.} Bxf6 17.Qb4 Qd7 18.Rae1 Rfe8
19.Bd2 a5 20.Qa3 {If 20.Rxe1+ Rxe1 21.Qxa5 Bxb2, White would
have a slight weakness in his a-pawn, but he might have
opposed the Rook on the e-file and probably escaped with a
draw.} Bh3 21.Bxh3 {His position is weak but this exchange
does not help him, but only develops Black's Queen to a strong
square. He ought to play Bc3.} Qxh3 22.Bc3 {The right move was
22.Rf2. Black might then have continued 22...Rxe1+ 23.Bxe1 Re8
24.Qxa5 Bxb2 25.Qd2 Qe6 26.Rf1 Qxa2, or 25.Bc3 Bxc3, followed
by Re2.} Re2 0-1
