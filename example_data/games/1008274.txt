5. a4 Bf5 6. e3 e6 7. Bxc4 {The whole system of defence was
introduced by me against Rubinstein and Bogoljuboff in the
London tournament of 1922. It was nearly twenty years before
it became a fashion.} Bb4 8. O-O O-O 9. Qe2 Ne4 {Rather
doubtful here would be c5 because of the move of the Russian
master Belavenetz 10.Na2! But 9...Bg4, played in this
tournament by Euwe against Bogoljuboff, seems also to be
satisfactory for Black.} 10. Nxe4 Bxe4 11. Rd1 Nd7 {The
following moves are easy to understand. White manages to get
control of the White squares, while Black in the meanwhile
completes his development.} 12. Bd3 Nf6 13. Ne5 Qc7 14. Bxe4

{Black's last move has prevented the advance b4, which might
eventually have given White a serious initiative on the
Q-side. The first player still has a small advantage in space,
and might try to profit by it with a carefully prepared Pawn
advance on the K-side, leading to the opening of files in that
section of the board. Whether such a plan would succeed or not
is of course another question; but there was a fighting
chance, without much risk.} 1/2-1/2
