1. Nf3 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. c4 c6 4. Nc3 {White
delays d4 until his opponent plays Nbd7, in order to obtain a
rather favorable variation of the Slav Defence. This line of
play introduced in the Moscow International Tournament of
1936, has the disadvantage, however, of not compelling Black
to answer with Nbd7.} Nbd7 {?} 5. cxd5 cxd5 6. d4 {Here we
are. White's queen knight is certainly better placed than
Black's. It is another question, of course, whether this small
advantage can be seriously increased.} e6 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O
O-O 9. Bd2 {Another and perhaps better plan would be 9 Qc2
(with the strategical threat of 10 Ne5) h6 (or Qc7 10 Bd2
followed by Rac1) 10 Rd1 and if a6 then 11 a4 b6 12 e4.} a6
10. a4 b6 11. Ne5 {The only chance of getting something out of
the position.} Nxe5 12. dxe5 Nd7 13. f4 f5 {Useless was f6
because of 14 Qh5.} 14. exf6 {If at once 14 Ne2 then Nc5
followed by Ne4. But after the exchange in the text White will
have about as many weaknesses as his opponent.} Nxf6 15. Ne2
Bd6 {with the object of answering 17 Nd4 with e5.} 16. Bc3 Qe8
{Not qe7 17 Nd4 e5 18 Nc6.} 17. Bc2 Bb7 18. Qd4 {hoping to
create complications. E.g., after 18...Bc5 19 Qe5 Qe7 20 Nd4
Ng4! 21 Qh5 Nf6 22 Qh3. But Winter defends his position, up to
a certain moment, excellently.} Qe7 19. Ng3 {Not 19 Qxb6 Bc5.}
Rac8 20. Qd3 {There is nothing better. White has obviously
lost valuable time.} Ne4 {Good enough to secure a level
game. But as White threatened nothing, Black could quietly
improve his position by, for instance, a5.} 21. Nxe4 dxe4
22. Qe2 Bd5 23. Rfd1 a5 24. Bb1 {A move like this clearly
shows that something is wrong with White's position. As a
matter of fact, Black has a slight advantage in space, and his
pawn at e5 can easily be protected.} Bc5 25. Kh1 Bb3 {The
beginning of a faulty speculation in which Black seems
temporarily to forget that he has a king! By 25...Rfd8 and if
26 Rc1 Bb4, etc., he would certainly not have to worry about
being able to draw.} 26. Rc1 Qd7 {? Obviously overlooking
White's 28th move.} 27. Bxe4 Bxa4 28. Qh5 {!} Rf5 {Or g6 29
Bxg6 Bc6 30 Qg4 and wins. The game is over.} 29. Bxf5 exf5
30. Bd4 Bxd4 31. Rxc8+ Qxc8 32. exd4 Bc6 33. Qe2 1-0
