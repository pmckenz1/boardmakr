1. d4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch. A game illustrating the small
(restricted) center .} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bg5 h6 {Of
questionable value : on balance the increae in possible
resources resulting from this move is less than the danger of
the loosening it ocacasions. Generally speaking, of the
restricted center should be avoided. A wide and active center
could more easily absorb some weakness on the wings. The
restricted center is too passive in this respect.} 4. Bh4 b6
5. Nbd2 Bb7 6. e3 Be7 7. Bd3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 {In order to
be able to play Bg3, without being exposed to an exchange by
...Na5; but 9 Qe2 and O-O-O with a K side attack looks much
more natural. The following opening is instructive on this
point : Black, Dr. Vidmar. 1 e3 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 b3 Bg4 4 Bb2

Bxa6 {Because he has at his disposal a manouver which is to
prove the weakness of the White squares to be illusory. Much
weaker would be 15...e5, because of 16 d5 with possibilities
on either flank.} 16. Qxa6 Qc7 17. Rac1 Rd7 18. b4 Rad8

of the restricted center were the slow evolutions of the major
pieces on inner lines (moves 16, 17, 18, 21 and 26 by Black.}
