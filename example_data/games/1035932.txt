1.d4 {Notes by J. Mason} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 {As to the
entire advisability of this, opinions differ. The early
exchange or subsequent retreat is thought not to be generally
favourable by many good players. Perhaps, on principle Nf3
should have preference ; the Bishop to be disposed as later
circumstances may require.} Be7 5.e3 O-O 6.Nf3 b6 7.Rc1 Bb7
8.cxd5 Nxd5 {To keep the diagonal open; a troublesome
undertaking. 8...exd5, with a 'majority on the Queen's side'
view, and power of later Ne4(if necessary), would probably
prove stronger. There is nearly always great danger to he
apprehended from the adverse Bishop at d3 in this class of
position.} 9.Bxe7 Qxe7 10.Nxd5 Bxd5 11.Bd3 Rc8 {The check
might be fairly ventured. But ...Bxa2 would be bad; for the
Bishop could be so shut in as to have no good escape.} 12.e4
Bb7 13.O-O Nd7 14.Qe2 a6 {Mr. Burn should have played c5
now. There was nothing to be feared from, e.g. 15 Ba6 Bxa6 17
Qxa6 Nf6 18 dxc5 Rxc5 19 Rxc5 Qxc5 19 Qb7 Qc8, etc. Even a
move or two further on c5 would be the better play. The
complications, deliberately courted, as it were, hereabouts,
are not at all to the advantage of the defence.} 15.Rc3 c6
16.Rfc1 b5 17.Qe3 Rc7 18.Qf4 Rac8 19.e5 {What may be called
the self-evident intent of this is most unaccountably ignored
by his opponent. The conclusion is reached by Mr. Pillsbury in
about the most forcible manner possible.} c5 {Further support
or protection of the King is imperative, 19...Nf8 seems
best. After this unfortunate oversight, Black's is really a
hopeless case. Nevertheless the ending is very instructive.}
20.Bxh7+ Kxh7 21.Ng5+ Kg8 22.Rh3 {Meaning mate in four--23
Rh8+, 24 Qh4+, etc. Hence the reply, making way for the
King. The attack is altogether overwhelming.} Qe8 23.Qh4 Kf8
24.Nh7+ Kg8 25.Nf6+ Kf8 26.Nxe8 Kxe8 27.Qg5 cxd4 28.Rh8+ {For
28...Nf8 29 Rxf8+ Kxf8 30 Rxc7 Re8 31 Rxb7 and White has a
Queen too much.} 1-0
