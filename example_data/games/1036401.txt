1. d4 {Notes by H. N. Pillsbury} d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 Nc6 {A
favorite idea of the Russian master, who aims to secure an
open game in this and similar variations of the queen's side
openings by advancing e5 at the earliest possible moment.}
4. f4 {Nf3 would be met by 4...Bg4 and if 5 Be2 Bxf3 6 Bxf3
e5, etc.} Nb4 5. Nf3 {5 Be2 Bf5 6 Na3 e6 7 c3 Nc6 8 Nc2 Ne4 9
Nf3 Bd6, etc., was probably a better method of procedure in
this position than the text continuation. Black's two bishops
come strongly in evidence later on, and the open c-file White
is not able to utilise.} Nxd3+ 6. cxd3 e6 7. O-O Be7 8. Nbd2
{Nc3 seems preferable.} O-O 9. Qc2 Bd7 10. Nb3 Ba4 11. Qc3 b6

22. Bxc5 bxc5 23. Qd2 Qd6 24. Ne2 Rcf8 25. Raf1 Qd5 26. Ng3 e5
{White has laboured under a disadvantage since the opening
owing to the weak pawn at d3, but Black up to this point has
been unable to make much out of it. With the text move he
prepares a deep trap involving the sacrifice of the exchange,
but obtains a winning superiority in pawn position.} 27. f5
{White could not afford this continuation. Better would be 27
Ne4 Rxf4 28 Rxf4 exf4 29 Rxf4 rxf4 30 Qxf4 (threatening the
check at b8) with fully an equal game.} c4 28. Ne4 cxd3
29. Nxf6+ Rxf6 30. Rc1 h6 31. Rc8+ Kh7 32. Qb4 Bc6 33. Qb8
{Rf8 was better but would not save the game either.} Rxf5
34. Rh8+ Kg6 35. Rf8 Rg5 36. R8f3 d2 0-1
