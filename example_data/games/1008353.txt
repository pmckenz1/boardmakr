1. e4 {Notes by Alekhine} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {On another
ocassion I would probably have played 3 b4 a sacrifice for
which White in this particular position has to my mind
sufficient strategical reasons. But playing for the first time
with the Soviet Champion, for whose play I have the greatest
appreciation, I did not like the idea of being accused of
overweening confidence, undue boldness ( and this independent
of the result of the game) or of such things as
"underestimating," "bluster", etc.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6
6. Be2 Bg7 7. Be3 {Already intending to make the following
pawn advance. Otherwise I would first play 7 O-O followed by
Nb3.} Nc6 8. Nb3 Be6 9. f4 {In order to be able to answer
9...d5 by 10 e5.} O-O 10. g4 {I first saw this interesting
move in a game of the talented Slovakian Master, Foltys, from
the recent tournament at Podebrad but did not know that it had
already experimented with in the Moscow Tournament. As the
present game shows, the move permits White to force a quick
draw - but no more.} d5 {! Already played by Botvinnik against
Lowenfish (Moscow, 1936) who answered 11 e5 d4 12 Nxd4 Nxd4 13
Bxd4 Nxg4 14 Qd3 a6 15 O-O-O with about even chances.} 11. f5
Bc8 12. exd5 Nb4 13. d6 {Doubtless the best move. If instead
13 fxg6 hxg6 14 Bf3 then 14...Nxg4 15 Bxg4 Bxg4 16 Qxg4 Nxc2+
17 Ke2 Nxa1 18 Rxa1 Bxc3 19 Qxd5 with rook and three pawns for
two minor pieces.} Qxd6 {Of course not 13...exd6 because of 14
g5 followed by f6.} 14. Bc5 {The alternative 14 Qxd6 exd6 15
O-O-O gxf5 was certainly not dangerous for Black.} Qf4 {!
Again the only move as 14...Qxd1+ 15 Rxd1! Nc6 (...Nxc2+ 16
Kd2) 16 g5 followed by 17 f6 etc., would give White a distinct
advantage.} 15. Rf1 {White, too, has nothing better than to
accept the piece sacrifice.} Qxh2 16. Bxb4 Nxg4 {This second
sacrifice forces the perpetual check.} 17. Bxg4 Qg3+ 18. Rf2
{Of course not 18 Kd2? ...Bh6+ and wins.} Qg1+ 19. Rf1 Qg3+
20. Rf2 Qg1+ 1/2-1/2
