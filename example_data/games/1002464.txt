5.d3 d6 6.Be3 Bb6 7.Qe2 Be6 8.h3 {More likely to do harm then
good in the opening. Bb3 was better.} Bxc4 9.dxc4 Ba5 {Ne7
followed by c6 or Ng6 was more adapted to give Black a good
gamethan this aim at a mere exchange of another piece.} 10.Bd2

g6 16.b4 {RAther bold, considering the position of his King.}
Qe6 17.Kb2 Nb6 {This was tempting, but it is the source of
Black's coming troubles. It was absolutely necessary to keep
his Knight at d7 so as to prevent any eventual advance of the
adverse c-pawn, which would strike at the root of Black's
position, while the advance of White's b-pawn would do no
harm. He should have played f5 at once.} 18.Kb3 f5 19.exf5

Ne7 25.Nf6 {White has excellently taken advantage of the
opponent's slight error, pointed in our last note, and he has
come out with a Pawn ahead. However, he hesitates now and
loses the fruit of his fine play, which ought to have secured
the victory if he had only played here c5 at once. Obviously,
if Black allowed his two Rooks to be exchanged, White would
afterward gain the e-pawn, and the latters two passed Pawns
would win without much difficulty. And if 25...Nd7 26.cxd6
cxd6 27.Rxd6, with two Pawns ahead, for Black dare not answer
by 27...Rxg4 on account of the rejoinder Rxd7, followed
ultimately by Nf6+.} Rg6 26.c5 Rxf6 27.cxb6 axb6 28.Bxe5 Rf3+
