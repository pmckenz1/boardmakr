1. Nf3 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} f5 2. b3 b6 3. Bb2 Bb7 4. g3
Bxf3 {This exchange appears to be unfavorable, for as will
soon be seen, the Black pawn-formation will lack mobility.}
5. exf3 e6 6. f4 Nf6 7. Bg2 c6 8. O-O Be7 9. Qe2 O-O {The
White bishops are strongly posted but have, as yet, little
effect.} 10. Na3 {This knight is placed into the service of
the bishops. In the sequel it will not only reconnoitre the
ground but lure on thre Black pawns. Its most important
function, however, will reveal itself only on the 13th move.}
a5 {The only way to develop the knight, ...b5 fails against
Nxb5.} 11. Nc4 a4 12. Bd4 b5 13. Ne5 {If, in the course of
play, I had looked upon this knight as an outpost on the K
file, there would have been no reason why I should publish
this game here; but I saw in this Kt nothing but a diagonal
outpost : a vague, up to now undefined diagonal effect
acquires, through posting the knight on e5, a definite aspect
with clear-cut objects of attack, in other words : the
diagonal action now obtains.} Nd5 {After 13...Na6 the
continuation would be, not sacrifices at c6, but simple
development by 14.Rfe1 followed by c4.} c4 bxc4 15. bxc4 Nb4
{With the understandable desire to take advantage of the
knights short stay in the central position (d5) according to
the motto "via the center into enemy land". The scheme,
however, proves disastrous. But with passive play (...Nc7) an
ultimate break-through by d4-d5 would have been decisive.}
16. Bc3 a3 17. d4 N8a6 18. Rab1 Rb8 19. c5 {Normally d5 is the
proper course, but the knights unfortunate position is more
easily exploited by the text-move.} Bf6 20. Rb3 Bxe5 21. fxe5
Qa5 {The only way to cover the a-pawn.} 22. Rfb1 Rb7 23. Qd2
Rfb8 24. Bf1 Qc7 {There is no saving clause.} 25. Bxb4 Nxb4
