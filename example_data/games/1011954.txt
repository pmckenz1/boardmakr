1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Bg5 {This
move is of doubtful value, for it allows the following reply,
hit upon by Duras. It is better to play Nc3 first.} h6 {!
After this move White has nothing better than to take the
Knight, leaving his opponent with two Bishops, for if the
Bishop retreats, the acceptance of the Gambit is in favour of
Black.} 5. Bh4 dxc4 {More precise would have been 5...Bb4+;
followed by dxc4; as then the Gambit Pawn could be held by
...b5, etc.} 6. Qa4+ {The only way of regaining the
Pawn. Black threatened 6...Bb4+; followed by 7...b5.} Nbd7
7. Qxc4 c5 8. Nc3 a6 {With the intention of developing the
Queen Bishop on the long diagonal, a plan which White, as the
sequel shows, will be unable to frustrate.} 9. a4 b5 {! Black
still persists, for if 10.axb5 axb5; the White Queen and Rook
would both be en prise.} 10. Qd3 c4 11. Qb1 Bb7 {! A Pawn
sacrifice, the object of which is to obstruct White's
development through pressure on c3.} 12. axb5 {It would have
been preferable to decline the offer of a Pawn. But in any
event, even after 12.e3 Qb6 White's position would have
remained distinctly inferior.} axb5 13. Nxb5 Bb4+ 14. Nc3 g5
15. Bg3 Ne4 16. Qc1 {All White's last moves were obviously
forced.} Nb6 {Threatening 17...Na4.} 17. Rxa8 Qxa8 18. Nd2
Nxd2 19. Kxd2 Qa2 {! Initiating the deciding manouver. Black
again threatens 20...Na4 and does not allow his opponent the
respite he needs to disentangle his position by 20.e3} 20. Kd1
Qb3+ 21. Qc2 {Now the Black c-Pawn will move straight on to
Queen.} Bxc3 22. bxc3 Be4 {! Simple and immediately decisive.}
23. Qxb3 cxb3 24. e3 {24.Kc1 Nc4 and mates in a few moves.} b2
0-1
