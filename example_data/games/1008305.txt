1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5
5. Nc3 {5 cxd5 cxd5 6 Qb3 gives White some initiative on the
queen side. After his next move Black has no further opening
difficulties.} e6 6. Nh4 {It is true that White gets the
advantage of two bishops, but he opens up for his adversary
the h-file and lessens his pressure on the central
squares. All in all his sheme is hardly to be recommended.}
Be4 7. f3 Bg6 8. Nxg6 hxg6 9. g3 {Black was threatening Nh5
which move could be played in case of 9 e4.} Bd6 10. f4 Ne4
11. Nxe4 dxe4 12. Bd2 Qe7 {Not necessary at this
moment. Instead g5 would give Black a good initiative.} 13. a3
{Also by no means convincing. If White intends to play Qb3 he
had better do so at once.} Nd7 14. Qb3 Rb8 15. Qa4 a6 16. Be2
g5 {At last.} 17. O-O-O f5 18. fxg5 {The initial of a rather
hidden sacrificial combination. Black's best chance now was to
start an immediate counter-attack by 18...b5 19 Qxa6 bxc4
followed eventually by O-O, etc. This would lead to some Wild
West play, of which the result would be by no means certain.}
Qxg5 19. c5 Bc7 {Black seems completely to overlook the
possibility of a sacrifice. After Be7 he would still have a
defensible position, although 20 Qb3 Rh6 21 g4! would give
White undeniably the initiative.} 20. Bxa6 {!} bxa6 {Useless
was 20...Ra8 21 Qb3! But with 20...O-O 21 Bc4 Qe7 the game
could be much longer defended. White would win then chiefly
because of his extra pawn.} 21. Qxc6 Kd8 22. Qxe6 {Besides
having full equivalent for his piece, White obtains also a
very strong attack against the exposed king. The game is
practically over.} Qf6 23. Qd5 {Threatening c6.} Ke7 24. Bb4
Rhc8 25. Kb1 {Threatening again c6+ which would here be
premature on account of 25...Bd6.} Nf8 26. g4 a5 27. Bc3 g6
28. gxf5 Qxf5 {If ...gxf5 then 29 Rhf1.} 29. Qc4 Ne6 30. Rhf1
Qh5 31. d5 Nxc5 32. d6+ {If ...Bxd6 then 33 Qf7+ and mate next
move.} 1-0
