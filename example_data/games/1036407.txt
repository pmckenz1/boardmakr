1. e4 {Notes by Dr. Tarrasch} e6 2. Qe2 b6 {Stronger is Be7 or
c5.} 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. Nh3 Nc6 5. d3 Qe7 {The whole game needs
very little comment. Both players open in an original manner,
and after a rather long fight for position Tchigorin gets an
opportunity for attack. Black loses the game not through any
particular mistake, but from White's stronger play in
general.} 6. Be3 O-O-O 7. f3 {In order to retire the Bishop to
f2 after Black's d5.} Nf6 8. O-O-O d5 9. Bf2 d4 10. Nb1 e5
11. Be1 Qe6 12. b3 h6 13. g3 g5 {Thi is not good, as now the
advance of White's f-Pawn and the opening of the f-file gain
importance.} 14. f4 g4 15. fxe5 Nxe5 16. Nf4 Qd6 {White has
now a much better game.} 17. Bg2 h5 18. Kb2 a5 19. Rf1 Be7
20. Bd2 Bc6 21. Rde1 Nfd7 22. Nd5 {The beginning of a decisive
attack.} Bxd5 23. exd5 Rde8 24. Rf5 f6 25. Qe4 Qc5 26. d6 {!}

{Black's position is broken up and will soon be entirely
destroyed. The position of White's Queen is peculiar, and also
the absolutely safe position of White's King, though only
protected by the Knight. It is also worthy of note that
Tchigorin took, from the 31st to the 39th move, no less than
fifty-six minutes, but each move is of greatest accuracy and
precision.} 31. Be4 Nd7 32. Bf5 Re5 33. Bxd7+ Kxd7 34. Qb7+
Bc7 35. Bf4 Qe7 36. Bxe5 Qxe5 37. Rf7+ Kd8 38. Rf8+ Ke7
39. Qc8 {This game, which was adjourned at the curious
position at the 31st move, caused much interesting discussion
in the interval as to whether White's Queen would get out
without loss, and the opinions expressed amongst the
spectators as to the chances of the game were remarkably
varied.- ED} 1-0
