1.e4 {Notes by Blackburne.} e5 2.Nc3 Bc5 3.f4 d6 4.Nf3 Nf6
5.Bc4 c6 6.d3 Qe7 {This line of defence was often adopted by
Anderssen, but is not now considered good.} 7.Qe2 b5 8.Bb3 a5
9.a4 b4 10.Nd1 Ba6 {This move prevents B or Ne3, but is not
good.} 11.fxe5 dxe5 12.Bg5 Nbd7 13.Ne3 Bxe3 {He cannot permit
Nf5. Tis move shows the weakness of Ba6.} 14.Qxe3 Nc5 15.Nd2
Qa7 {To release the Knight and threatening Nxd3+ if Bxf6. A
move with great possibilities but h6 was the sounder.} 16.Qg3
{This illuminates the weak spot in Black's last move.} Nfd7
17.Be3 {Pinning the Knight and threatening to Castle.} g6
18.O-O O-O 19.Qf2 Kg7 {It is difficult to suggest anything
better.} 20.Qh4 {AS MR Steinitz has it, playing for higher
game than a Pawn.} f6 21.Qh6+ Kh8 22.Rf3 {Black is now menaced
with an irresistable attack.} Rae8 23.Qxh7+ Kxh7 24.Rh3+ Kg7
25.Bh6+ Kh8 26.Bxf8# {This was the first game finished in the
New York Tournament. It was plyed on the board on which Morphy
played his immortal game with Paulsen, and which was brought
specially for me to play on.} 1-0
