1. e4 {Notes by Alekhine} c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 {Quite a
harmless variation, which offers Black many good possibilities
of defence.} g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Nge2 e6 {Black already having
the control over d4 protects d5, thus obtaining a certain
advantage in the middle. A promising strategy which could be
successfully met only by very energetic play.} 6. d3 Nge7
7. O-O {? Too indifferent, he should make a demonstration on
the K-side by 7.h4 and 8.Bg5; if 7...h6 then Bf4 followed by
Qd2 and Black would have more difficulties in completing his
mobilisation than in the actual game.} O-O 8. Be3 {And here
8.Bg5 or Bf4 was better. White should leave himself the
possibility of taking the intruding Knight at d4 with his own
Knight.} Nd4 9. Qd2 d5 10. Nf4 {Comparatively better was
10.Nd1 in order to dislodge, as rapidly as possible, the
powerful Knight.} dxe4 11. dxe4 Qc7 12. Rad1 {Other methods
like 12.Rfc1 followed by Qe1 would have their inconveniences
too. The game is already very difficult to defend.} Rd8
13. Qc1 b6 14. Rfe1 Ba6 15. Kh1 {? This move, and not the next
one as was generally suggested, is the decisive
mistake. White's last chance of salvation consisted in 15.Nb1
with the intention 16.c3, and if 15...g5 16.Nd3 h6 then 17.f4
with some kind of counter-play. After the King's move the game
is strategically hopeless.} Nec6 16. Nfe2 {Only shortens the
end. The threats 16...Ne5 or eventually (in case of 16.Nb1 for
instance) 16...Nb4 were too strong.} Nxe2 17. Rxd8+ Rxd8
18. Nxe2 Bxe2 19. Rxe2 Bxb2 20. Qxb2 Rd1+ 21. Bf1 Rxf1+
22. Kg2 Rd1 23. Rd2 Rxd2 24. Bxd2 Qe5 {! Forcing an endgame in
which besides the extra Pawn he will possess a powerful Knight
against an anemic Bishop.} 25. Qxe5 Nxe5 26. Bc3 f6 27. Bxe5
{One has the impression that White wants to finish the game as
rapidly as possible; the Pawn endgame does not offer, of
course, any chance.} fxe5 28. a4 Kf7 29. Kf3 c4 30. Ke3 Ke7
