1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 c5
5. Bxc4 e6 6. O-O Nc6 7. Qe2 a6 8. Rd1 b5 9. Bb3 c4 10. Bc2
Nb4 11. Nc3 Nxc2 12. Qxc2 Bb7 13. d5 {This whole variation has
been exhaustively analysed in the course of the last few
years, and the text move has - since the games
Eliskases-Flohr, Hastings, 1933-34, and Vidmar- Grunfeld,
Warsaw, 1935 - been considered to give White a strong
initiative. Flohr's innovation in the present game seems to
rehabilitate the whole line of defence.} Qc7 {! The main idea
of this is to block the center by e5 in case White plays 14
e4. 13...exd5 instead , as played in the games mentioned
above, would be answered by 14 e4 with good effect.} 14. e4
{As 14 dxe6 fxe6 15 e4 does not work on account of b4 there is
nothing better than to complete the development of the
forces.} e5 15. Bg5 {If immediately 15 Be3 then Ng4.} Nd7
16. Be3 Bc5 {Black obviously considers the opening problem as
already solved, and does not intend to simplify. By 16...Bd6
he would have more chances of taking advantage of his majority
on the Q side, inasmuch as White could certainly obtain
nothing by a demonstration on the other wing, such as 17 Nh4
g6 18 Bh6 f6.} 17. Bxc5 Qxc5 18. b3 {! This is now possible as
b5 can be answered by 19 Na4.} O-O 19. bxc4 Qxc4 20. Nd2 Qc7
21. Qb2 Rfc8 22. Rac1 Nc5 23. Nb3 {After ...Nxb3 followed by
...Qd6, Black would still have the slightly better game
because of his Q side pawn majority.} 1/2-1/2
