This new move, introduced by the Estonian master, J. Turn,
throws an entirely new light upon the so-called main variation
of the Slav defence to the Queen’s Gambit. By postponing the
exchange at e5, White succeeds in taking “advantage of the
greater freedom of his pieces and is able at least to deprive
his opponent of one of his bishops. In the further course of
the match I did not succeed in finding a way to meet this
move, and it seems that Alekhine did not find any
either. Therefore we both avoided this variation when we had
the Black pieces. The first thirteen moves of this game are
the same as those in the twentieth and twenty-first games of
the first match.} Bb4 { Black must castle as soon as possible,
otherwise the weakness on the square, d6, would become
dangerous. On the other hand, 14...Bxc4 15 Qxc4 Nxc4 16 Bxc7
Rc8 17 Bf4, would have led to a better endgame for White.}
15. a5 O-O {Best, as 15...a6 would have weakened Black’s
position, in addition to losing a tempo.} 16. a6 {Forceful
enough, but probably not the best. More appropriate, in order
to keep the initiative, would be 16 Ra4 Be7 17 Nxe5 Nxe5 18
Nc5 Bc8 (or ...Bf7 19 Bh3).} bxa6 {? A move which, as a matter
of fact, should not even be taken into consideration, as it
seriously weakens the pawn position without
compensation. Correct was 16...b6; and then if 17 Nxe5 Nxe5 18
Bxe5 Qxe5!, after which White could not play 19 Qxc6 because
of 19...Rc8 20 Qa4 Rc4! The best for White after 16...b6 would
be 17 Nxe5 Nxe5 18 Qe3, still keeping a shade the initiative.}
17. Nxe5 Nxe5 {Forced, since 17...fxe5 would lose after 18
Ng5.} 18. Nc5 Bxc5 {Black cannot play 18...Bc8 because of 19
Bxe5 followed by 20 Qc4+ winning a piece.} 19.Qxc5 g5 {There
is no longer a satisfactory line for Black. After the
plausible 19...Qb6 White would maintain his advantage by
answering 20 Qc3!} 20. Be3 Bd5 {In order to eliminate at least
one of White’s bishops, he had to lose a pawn in any case.}
21. Rxa6 Bxg2 22. Kxg2 { Avoiding the pitfall 22 Rxa7 Bxf1 23
Rxc7 Rd1 after which White would get into trouble.} Rf7
23. Rfa1 {And not 23 Rxa7 Qxa7 24 Qxa7 Rxa7 25 Bxa7; allowing
Black to equalize by 23...Rd2.} Qd6 24. Qxd6 Rxd6 25. Rxa7
{Perhaps even better—and in any case simpler—was 25 b4.} Rxa7
26. Rxa7 Nc4 { Thus Black obtains some counter chances which,
however, are not quite sufficient to save the game.} 27. Bc5
Re6 {After 27...Rd2 White could play either 28 Be7 with
variations analogous to that in the actual game, or 28 b3 Ne5
29 e4.} 28. Bd4 { Equally good was 28 b3, as after 28...Nd2 29
Be3 Nxb3 30 Ra3, Black would have been obliged to sacrifice
the exchange.} Rxe2 {Obviously his only, though very slight
chance.} 29. Bxf6 g4 {If 29...Nxb2? 30 Ra2. After the pawn
move actually played White would lose a piece if he continued
30 Rg7+ Kf8 31 Rxg4? Ne3+ 32 Kf3 Nxg4 33 Kxe2 Nxf6.} 30. Kf1
{But after this intermediate move all is practically over.}
Rc2 {Or 30...Re6 31 Bc3.} 31. Rg7+ Kf8 32. Rxg4 Nxb2 33. Bxb2
{Clearly foreseeing that the rook and pawn ending is an easy
technical win. There were, of course, other good continuations
here, but in such cases simplification is, in my belief,
always advisable.} Rxb2 34. Rc4 Rb6 { With a pawn to the good,
an active rook’s position, and, above all, the possibility of
obtaining in the near future two connected passed pawns,
White’s game is absolutely won.} 35. Ke2 Kf7 36. Rh4 Kg6
37. Rf4 Rb3 38. Rc4 Rb6 39. Ke3 {By his manoeuvre in moves
36—38 White has forced the Black king to go farther away from
the centre.} Kf5 40. g4+ Ke6 {Or 40...Kg5 41 f3 followed by 42
Rc5+.} 41. f4 {The sealed move.} Kd5 42. Rd4+ Ke6 {Or 42...Kc5
43 f5.} 43. f5+ Ke7 44. Re4+ Kf7 45. h4 Rb1 46. Kf4 Rc1
47. Ra4 {Obtaining possession of the seventh rank.} h6
48. Ra7+ Kg8 49. g5 Rc4+ 50. Ke5 {For if now ...Rxh4, then 51
g6.} 1-0
