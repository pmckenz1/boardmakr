1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bg5 {A harmless
move which could also be quite well answered by 3...Bf5.} e6
4. e3 c5 5. c3 Be7 6. Nbd2 Nbd7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O Qc7 {As
9.Ne5 would not be in White's favor after 9...Nxe5 10.dxe5
Nd7, etc., Black had better play at once 8...b6; and if 9.e4
then dxe4 10.Nxe4 Bb7 etc., as in the actual game.} 9. Qe2 {If
White intended to play e4, he should do that at once. After
9...dxe4 10.Nxe4 b6 11.Qc2 h6 12.Bh4 followed by Bg3 the Black
Queen would have no suitable square. After the text move Black
finishes his development and White has not the slightest
chance to get an advantage.} b6 10. e4 dxe4 11. Nxe4 Bb7
12. dxc5 Nxc5 13. Nxc5 Qxc5 14. Bxf6 {White-it is obvious
now-only plays for a draw. Under these conditions it is
generally difficult for the second player to complicate
matters without taking chances.} Bxf6 15. Be4 Bxe4 16. Qxe4
Qb5 {! Practically dislodges the Queen from her central
position.} 17. Qc2 Rfd8 18. Rfd1 g6 19. h3 {In this type of
position the Bishop is worth more than the Knight, which has
not any permanent squares in the middle. Further play,
beginning for instance 19...Rac8, was therefore still
possible. Against a player of Dr. Tartakover's experience,
however, it is doubtful if it would prove successful.} 1/2-1/2
