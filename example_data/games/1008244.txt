1. Nf3 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. d4 d5 3. Bg5 e6 4. e3 {By
renouncing the attack on the center through c4 White can only
hope to get an even game. In fact Black has not the slightest
trouble in developing his pieces efficiently.} c5 5. Nbd2 Nbd7
{In harmony with the subsequent development of queen and
rook.} 6. c3 Qb6 7. Qc2 Bd6 8. Bd3 h6 9. Bh4 O-O 10. O-O Qc7
11. Bg3 a6 {Black intended to continue the development of his
queen bishop with a pawn advance on the queen side. Otherwise
he could as well play here 11...Bxg3 12 hxg3 b6 and if 13 e4
dxe4 followed by Bb7.} 12. Rad1 b5 13. dxc5 {Slightly better
was 13 Bxd6 Qxd6 14 dxc5 Nxc5 15 e4. But the text move was
good enough for equality.} Bxg3 14. hxg3 Nxc5 15. Nb3 { ? It
is difficult to explain why the "routinier" (as Dr. Tartakover
calls himself) yields to his opponent full control of the
center, with no compensation. The course indicated was 15 e4
Nxd3 16 Qxd3 dxe4 17 Nxe4 Nxe4 18 Qxe4 Bb7 19 Qe3 with an even
game.} Nxd3 16. Qxd3 e5 17. Nh2 Rd8 {? Black's advantage was
overwhelming, and the most natural way to exploit it was a
"minority attack" starting with ...a5. It is surprising that
Fine, here as well as in the next few moves, appears not to
think of this. His play in the following part of the game is
not exactly weak, but lacks a definite plan. Tartakover, on
the contrary makes the outmost of his inferior position, and
finally succeeds to saving half a point.} 18. Rfe1 Be6 19. Qe2
Ne4 {The knight manoeuver cannot be commended. He could still
play Rab8 followed by a5.} 20. Rc1 Rac8 21. Red1 Qc4 22. Qe1
Qc7 {Admitting by this that his last move was useless.}
23. Qe2 Nd6 24. Nd2 Qb6 25. a3 Nc4 26. Nxc4 bxc4 27. Rd2 Bf5
{Black is still slightly superior and might try to get up an
attack on the b-pawn with Rb8, etc. The text move allows his
alert opponent to obtain further simplification.} 28. Qh5 {!}
Qg6 {If ...Qf6 then 29 Nf3 and eventually g4.} 29. Qxg6 Bxg6
30. f4 {! Just at the right moment as 30...f6 would now be
inferior because of 31 fxe5 fxe5 32 Ng4.} exf4 31. gxf4 Rb8
32. Rcd1 Be4 33. Ng4 {Practically forcing the exchange of the
remaining minor pieces, with an unavoidable draw.} Rb6 34. Nf2
Rdb8 35. Nxe4 dxe4 36. Rd8+ Rxd8 1/2-1/2
