1. d4 {Notes by Lasker} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7
5. e3 Nbd7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Rc1 c6 8. Bd3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 b5 {If
Black wants to adopt this particular defence (instead of
...Nd5) it is better to play first 8...h6 and after 9 Bh4
dxc4, etc. The difference will soon be apparent.} 10. Bd3 a6
11. a4 {This move-which would be the best, had Black already
played h6-leads here to practically nothing. 10 e4, on the
other hand, which would be bad after ...h6 Bh4 because of the
answer Nxe4! (see Euwe-Alekhine 28th match game) would here
secure an appreciable advantage in space.} bxa4 12. Nxa4 Qa5+
13. Nc3 {Here is the difference. White cannot play 13 Nd2, his
queen bishop being lose.} c5 {This weakness being eliminated,
Black will have no difficulty in equalising the game.} 14. Ra1
Qb4 15. O-O Bb7 {15...Qxb4 was inadvisable as after 16 Nb5
White would threaten not only 17 Nc7 but also Rb1-a1-b1 with a
secure draw.} 16. Qe2 {Sugessting a series of exchanges, after
which the remaini9ng pawn material makes a peaceful result
almost inevitable.} cxd4 17. exd4 Bxf3 18. Qxf3 Qxd4 19. Bxa6
Qb6 20. Bb5 Rxa1 21. Rxa1 Ne5 22. Qe2 Ng6 23. Be3 {The two
bishops are of little value here, since they have no weak
points to attack; and the advance of the b-pawn can easily be
prevented. Dr. Lasker's defence has been, as usual, very
accurate.} Qb8 24. g3 Rc8 25. Ba7 Qc7 26. Ra6 Qb7 27. Bc4
{This attempt to advance the b-pawn merely leads to further
simplification.} Ne5 28. Qxe5 Rxc4 29. Qb8+ Qxb8 30. Bxb8 Rc8
31. Bd6 Bxd6 32. Rxd6 Rb8 33. Rd2 Kf8 1/2-1/2
