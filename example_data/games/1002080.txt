1.e4 {Analysis by Wilhelm Steinitz.} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6
4.O-O Bc5 {Irregular and incorrect. ...Nxe4 is the best move
here.} 5.Nc3 {White could have obtained the better game
immediately by Nxe5.} d6 6.d3 h6 {Useless for the defense, and
at least premature for the attack.} 7.Ne2 Bd7 8.c3 a6 {This
advance drives the adverse bishop to a better post, to which
White anyhow intended to retreat. The move is also specially
objectionable under the circumstances that he intends O-O-O.}
9.Ba4 Qe7 10.Ng3 O-O-O 11.b4 Bb6 {Ba7 might have saved some
valuable time on the 17th move.} 12.b5 Nb8 13.bxa6 Nxa6
14.Bxd7+ Nxd7 15.d4 g6 16.a4 Rdf8 17.a5 Ba7 18.Rb1 Ndb8 19.Qb3
c6 20.Ba3 {White pursues his attack with admirable
correctness. He can win a pawn at once by dxe5, followed by
Nxe5, but he justly prefers the move in the text as a
preliminary, which establishes connection between the two
rooks and also compels the adversary to block his pieces still
more, for he threatens now Bxd6, and Black's answer is
forced.} c5 21.dxe5 dxe5 22.Nxe5 Qc7 23.Nc4 h5 24.e5 h4 25.Ne4
h3 26.Qxb7+ Qxb7 27.Ncd6+ Kd8 28.Rxb7 hxg2 29.Rfb1 Nc6 30.Bc1
{Powerful and accurate.} Nc7 31.Bg5+ Kd7 32.Rxc7+ {Winning two
pieces, for obviously if Kxc7, White mates by Rb7.} Ke6
33.Rxc6 c4 34.Bf6 Rh5 35.Rd1 Rh3 36.Rc7 1-0
