1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 {The
modern defence which has not as yet found its refutation.} Nc6
5. Nf3 {After 5 e3 Black can play 5...e5 at once (Keres
vs. Alekhine, Dresden, 1936.} d6 6. a3 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 a5 {The
necessity for this move depends on the right solution of the
question whether Black can sacrifice a pawn by playing 8...e5;
after 7...O-O 8 b4. In the game Fine vs. Van den Bosch
(Amsterdam, 1936) Black after 9 dxe5 dxe5 10 Nxe5 Nxe5 11 Qxe5
Re8 12 Qb2 (Flohr's move introduced a new move 12...Qd3, which
brought his opponent into difficulties. Although White finally
won the game the whole variation still deserves a closer
examination.} 8. Bg5 {As the bishop can hardly avoid the
exchange a more promising development appears to be 8 g3 or
even 8 b3.} h6 9. Bxf6 {Very harmless. But after 9 Bh4 the
pinning of the knight would be without much effect as Black
would always have the move.} Qxf6 10. e3 O-O 11. Be2 e5 {Black
has obviously not the slightest difficulties.} 12. dxe5 dxe5
13. O-O Bg4 {This manoeuver is out of place as Black's squares
d7 and d5 are not sufficiently protected. But also after the
better move 13...Bf5 White would proceed to liquidate on the
open queen's file.} 14. h3 Bh5 15. Rfd1 Rfe8 {Otherwise
White's next move would have threatened Black's e-pawn.}
16. Rd5 Bg6 {Black admits that the bishop's excursion was
useless.} 17. Rad1 Bf5 18. R5d2 {If 18 Rb5 simply 18...Rab8
and Black's position would remain safe.} 1/2-1/2
