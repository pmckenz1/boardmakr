1. Nf3 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 {This
defence, in some aspects similar to the Hanham, was often
adopted by Tchigorin who did not mind defensive cramped
positions. Nowadays it is mostly played in connection with the
fianchetto of the king's bishop, in fact a more promising
procedure.} 4. g3 e5 5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 c6 8. e4
{Another effective line of development is 8 b3 followed by
Bb2.} Qc7 9. h3 Re8 10. Be3 Nf8 {? The first of a series of
weak moves, which rapidly ruin Black's position. His best
chance to obtain some activity for his pieces in spite of the
weak d-pawn was 10...exd4 11 Nxd4 Nc5 12 Qc2 a5; or 11 Bxd4
Nb6, etc.} 11. Rc1 h6 {? Either loss of time or preparation
for a bad move (g5). Indicated was 11...Bd7.} 12. d5 Bd7 {If
12...g5 then 13 h4 Ng4 14 hxg5 Nxe3 15 fxe3 hxg5 16 Nh2
followed by Qh5 etc.} 13. Nd2 g5 {? After this the game can
hardly be saved. A much lesser evil was 13...Ng6 14 f4 exf4 15
gxf4 Bf8 etc.} 14. f4 gxf4 15. gxf4 Kg7 16. fxe5 {The attack
from now on is very easy to conduct as there are "many roads
to Rome".} dxe5 17. c5 cxd5 {? Black sees that he must lose
anyhow and does not even try to resist. After 17...Qc8 16 d6
Bd8 the attack would not develop quite as rapidly as in the
actual game.} 18. Nxd5 Qc6 19. Nc4 Ng6 20. Nd6 {Decisive as
the Black rook cannot move. If for instance 20...Rf8 then 21
Qd2 Rh8 22 Qf2 and wins.} Be6 21. Nxe7 {Instead of taking the
exchange plus a pawn by 21 Nxe8+ Rxe8 22 Nxe7 followed by
Bxh6+ and Rxf6, White prefers to sacrifice material in order
to buid up a mating attack. It is difficult to say which of
the two methods is stronger as they both secure the win. But
certainly Botvinnik's way is the more elegant.} Nxe7 {If
21...Rxe7 22 Nf5+ and wins.} 22. Rxf6 {The continuation is by
no means difficult, but makes a specially pleasant impression
because of the text-moves are of a so-called "quiet" nature,
that is, without checks.} Kxf6 23. Qh5 {Threatening mate in
two.} Ng6 24. Nf5 {!} Rg8 {If 24...Rh8 then simply 25 Rf1.}
25. Qxh6 Bxa2 26. Rd1 Rad8 27. Qg5+ {A more logical move was
first 27 Rxd8.} Ke6 28. Rxd8 f6 29. Rxg8 Nf4 30. Qg7 1-0
