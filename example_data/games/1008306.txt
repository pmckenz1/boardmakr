1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 e6
5. Bd3 {Permitting Black to enter into a variation of the
Queen's Gambit accepted instead of adopting the more usual 5
Nc3 Nbd7, etc., leading to the Meran defence.} dxc4 6. Bxc4 c5
7. O-O a6 8. Nc3 b5 9. Bb3 Bb7 10. Qe2 Nc6 {? After White has
placed his bishop at b3 (instead of d3, as in the game
Lasker-Reshevsky, Nottinham, 1936) it would not be advisable
for Black to exchange pawns in the center, as in that case
White's pressure against e6 and f7 would become
dangerous. Much better than the text move was 10...Nbd7 not
allowing White's d-pawn to advance with gain of tempo, and
keeping the balance of the position.} 11. Rd1 Qb6 12. d5 {! A
well-known manoeuver in positions of this kind {see
Opocensky-Rubinstein, Marienbad 1933-4) which in this
particular case is exceptionally strong, as Black is not yet
able to castle.} exd5 {? The decisive mistake. A much better
fighting chance was 12...Na5 13 e4 (13 dxe6 fxe6, etc.) Nxb3
14 axb3 b4 15 Na4 Qb5.} 13. e4 {After this Black has no
satisfactory defence. If 13...d4 then 14 e5! Ng4 15 Nd5 Qd8 16
Bf4 with the double threat 17 e6 or 17 Nf6+, the attack being
overwhelming.} dxe4 14. Nxe4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4+ Be7 {A pretty
variation would occur after 15...Ne7 16 Ne5! c4 17 Nxc4! bxc4
18 Ba4+ Bc6 19 Rd6 Rc8 20 Bg5 f6 21 Re1 with a winning
position.} 16. Bd5 Rd8 17. Bg5 Rxd5 {After ...f6 18 Bf4 Black,
with his king in the middle, would be helpless against the
numerous threats.} 18. Rxd5 O-O 19. Rd7 {! Without this move
White would still have some technical difficulties, but now
things are easy.} Bd8 20. Rc1 {? Not the best, although good
enough. Immediately decisive was 20 b4! (cxb4 21 Be3, etc.) }
Bc7 21. Qe3 Nb8 22. Re7 Bxf3 23. Qxf3 h6 {In consequence of
White's 20th move Black was in a position to make a longer
resistance by playing here 20...Nc6.} 24. Bf4 Bd6 {? Another
blunder. But Black's game was already perfectly hopeless.}
25. Rb7 Qd8 26. Rd1 1-0
