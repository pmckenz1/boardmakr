1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6
5. g3 Nc6 {A very well known stratagem, which was specially
patronised by British masters. At this particular moment,
however, it seems unnecessary, as Black could immediately play
e5. The variation 6 dxe5 dxe5 7 Qxd8+ Kxd8 followed by c6,
etc., was not dangerous for him.} 6. d5 Nb8 7. Bg2 e5 8. Nge2
Nbd7 9. h3 h6 {White's last move, aiming at Be3, was
correct. But the fact that Black, already handicapped by a
lack of space, allows himself to lose time also is sheer
carelessness, He should plat at once a5.} 10. Be3 a5 11. a3
O-O 12. O-O Nc5 {Allowing White to increase his positional
advantage on the Q side. A lesser evil was 12...b6 followed -
if 13 b4 for instance - by ...Nh5.} 13. b4 axb4 14. axb4 Rxa1
15. Qxa1 Na6 16. Qa3 Nh5 {This rather harmless attempt is made
under the conviction that White's advance on the other wing
cannot be stopped in the long run. If, e.g., 16...b6 the reply
would be 17 Nb5 threatening Na7-c6.} 17. b5 Nb8 18. g4 Nf6
19. c5 dxc5 20. Bxc5 Re8 21. Rc1 Nbd7 22. Bb4 {? With this and
the following poor moves White transforms a far superior
position into a lost one. After 22 Be3 Black would find no
compensation for the obvious weakness of his Q side and it
would be easy for White to increase his pressure. He probably
overlooked Black's 23rd move completely.} h5 23. f3 {? The
game after this is lost by force. His best chance was to try
to create complications with 23 g5 Nh7 24 h4 f6 25 Qb3 giving
him some fighting chances.} Bh6 24. Rd1 {The sacrifice of the
exchange - e.g., by 24 Nd1 - would merely prolong the game
without saving it.} hxg4 25. fxg4 Be3+ 26. Kh2 {If Kf1 Black
also plays Nxg4 followed by Qh4.} Nxg4+ 27. hxg4 Qh4+ 28. Bh3
Nf6 {Mate is forced in a few moves.} 0-1
