5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 Bb7 7.Rc1 Nbd7 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Bd3 O-O 10.O-O Ne4
{A good move. It opens up the game, and the Knight canot be
taken with impunity.} 11.Bf4 c5 12.Qe2 f5 {This creates a
weakness on e6. Ndf6 was probably better.} 13.Rfd1 c4 {g5
would have been more attacking.} 14.Bxe4 fxe4 15.Ne5 Nf6 16.g4
Qe8 17.Qf1 Bd6 18.h3 Rd8 19.Qg2 b5 20.Ne2 b4 21.Ng3 {White's
only chance is an attack on the King's side to prevent the
advance of Black's dangerous Pawns on the Queen's side.} Nd7
22.Nxd7 Rxd7 23.Ne2 Bxf4 24.Nxf4 Rdf7 25.g5 Rf5 {To be able to
play h6 on the advance of White's Knight's Pawn.} 26.Kh1 a5
27.Rg1 Bc8 28.Qg3 {The beginning of a combination. Tempting
Black to attack the weak Pawns on the Queen's side.} Qa4 {He
yields to the temptation.} 29.b3 cxb3 30.axb3 Qxb3 31.Rc7 {A
Rook established on the seventh rank is often as good as a
passed Pawn.} a4 {"Unconscious of their doom, the little
victims play." At this stage the adjournment occurred, and
White was called on to make his sealed move. Before play was
resumed, Lipschutz was asked how his game stood. "He has a
little bit of an attack," he answered, "But my two passed
Pawns must win," a view that was endorsed by Steinitz. On
opening the envelope, and finding my move g6, he still thought
himself safe; but the next move, Rxg7+ came upon him like a
thunderbolt, and caused the greatest excitement among the
spectators, of whom Steinitz was one. He bent his head over
the board, and would scarcely believe that a mating position
had been created.} 32.g6 h6 33.Rxg7+ Kxg7 {If ...Kh8, the
following might have occurred 34.Rh7+ Kg8 35.g7 Rg5 36.gxf8=Q+
Kxf8 37.Ne6+ Bxe6 and White mates in two moves.}34.Nh5+ Rxh5
35.Qc7+ Kf6 36.Qd6+ 1-0
