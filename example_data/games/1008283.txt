1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7
5. Bg2 c5 6. d5 exd5 7. Nh4 Qc7 {Instead of this 7...g6
adapted by Capablanca against me in New York, 1927, is
certainly more logical then the plan chosen by the
text-move. For after castling on the queen side Black will be
left with a by no means safe king's position and without
chances to form an attack on the other wing.} 8. cxd5 d6
9. O-O Nbd7 10. Nc3 a6 11. e4 g6 12. f4 O-O-O {Practically
forced as 12...Bg7 13 e5 dxe5 14 fxe5 Nxe5 15 d6 followed by
Re1, etc., would lead to a quick debacle.} 13. Be3 {As there
is nothing decisive after the pawn sacrifice 13 e5 dxe5 14
fxe5 Qxe5 because of the possible check at d4 this move cannot
be condemned. But White misses his way by the next two moves.}
Bg7 14. Kh1 {? This was not important for the moment. By
playing 14 a4 Rhe8 15 Bf2 followed by Rc1 and eventually b4 he
would still maintain strong pressure, thus proving the
unsoundness of Black's development.} Rhe8 15. a4 {? Either
completely overlooking the following combination, or
underestimating the strength of the sasrifice on Black's 18th
move. He should play 15 Bf2 although after 15...b5 Black's
prospects would already be slightly better than in the
variation indicated above.} Nxe4 {! This pretty stroke
completely frees Black's game and after White yields to the
temptation to win the exchange gives very good prospects of
victory.} 16. Nxe4 f5 17. Ng5 Rxe3 18. Ne6 {It is surprising
that Dr. Vidmar prefers this dubiuos enterprise to the
alternative 18 Nxh7 Nf6 (or ...Bxb2 19 Rb1 followed by 20
Nxg6) 19 Ng5 with chances for both sides. After the following
variation he should have lost.} Rxe6 19. dxe6 Nf6 {With the
prospects of winning a second pawn, and the two powerful
bishop diagonals (as 20 Bxb7+ Qxb7+ 21 Qf3 etc., would lead to
a lost end-game for White) Black had only technical work to
do.} 20. Nf3 Re8 21. Qb3 Ne4 22. Rad1 {White still hopes
against hope.} d5 {? And here it is! First 22...Qc6 and then
d5 would increase Black's position in a decisive way. Even
22...c4 was good enough.} 23. Rxd5 {Naturally!} Bxd5 24. Qxd5
{The worst is over inasmuch as Black is tremendously short of
time.} Qb7 {? This second mistake loses a game which could
still be defended by 24...Kb8 25 Ng5 Rd8 etc.} 25. Qb3 Qc6
26. Ng5 Bd4 {There is nothing to be done. If 26...h6 then 27
Nxe4 fxe4 28 Re1 and wins, as Black cannot take the e-pawn on
account of Bh3.} 27. Qd3 Qxa4 28. Nxe4 fxe4 29. Qxe4 Qb5
30. Qb7+ Kd8 31. Re1 Bf6 32. Qb8+ 1-0
