1.d4 {Notes by S. Tinsley} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 Be7 5.e3
O-O 6.Be2 {In a very similar position recently (Steinitz
v. Lasker, St. Petersburg, January 9, 1896) the first player
proceeds with c5, which is doubtless generally regarded with
distrust. It is curious that White seems to have no better
move than the text, which appears to amount to nothing if the
Bishop has to take the Pawn subsequently. Ne5 has points,
supported later by f4, and that may eventually turn out to be
the strongest continuation.} dxc4 7.O-O c5 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.Bxc4
a6 10.Qe2 b5 11.Bb3 Bb7 12.Bd2 {Rd1 suggests itself at once as
a more vigorous line of play. e4 would be good now, but for
the reply b4.} Nbd7 13.Rfd1 Qe7 14.Be1 b4 15.Na4 {The question
naturally occurs, what is the future of this Piece? Nb1 was
probably superior, notwithstanding appearances to the
contrary. Afterwards Nbd2, and then to c4, or f1, as
circumstances suggest.} Bd6 16.Qd3 {By first playing Bc2, a
good deal might be threatened later, and the disagreeable
counter-attack by Black would have been at least deferred.}
Bb8 17.Rac1 Bxf3 {The exchange, not generally favourable in
such positions, is here evidently in Black's favour. He makes
a doubled Pawn at once, and has many good prospects of a
King's side attack.} 18.gxf3 Ne5 19.Qe2 g5 20.Rd4 a5 21.f4
gxf4 22.Rxf4 Kh8 23.f3 {White has already drifted into a most
unsatisfactory position, and this is one of the best of a
number of poor defences. It will be noted that White's Rook is
in a line with Black's King's Bishop, and that some means must
be found to prevent a fatal attack by Black’s Qh4,
etc. later.} Nh5 24.Rd4 Ba7 25.Bh4 Qb7 26.Re4 f5 {A very
charming resource, the point of which is not at first sight
apparent, but is disclosed in the following moves.} 27.Rxe5
Qg7+ 28.Kh1 Qxe5 29.Rc6 Ng7 30.Bf2 Rad8 31.Nb6 Bxb6 32.Rxb6
Qc5 33.e4 {We have indicated a few weak points in White's play
in our 2nd, 3rd, and 4th notes. We are informed, and the game
bears out the statement, that White was short of time at one
or two points. In such a difficult game it is no wonder White
went astray under those circumstances. In the latter part of
this game we can suggest no variation satisfactory to him. On
the other hand, Herr Bardeleben, if by no means enterprising,
conducts his attack with deadly accuracy and force.} Qc1+
34.Be1 fxe4 35.Qxe4 Rf4 36.Qe2 Rdf8 37.Kg2 Rxf3 38.Qe5 a4
{Leading up to a very pretty winning move,...Qc4.} 39.Bxa4 Qc4
40.Bb5 Qg4+ {If 41 Bg3 Rf2+ 42 Kh1 or Kg1 43 Qd1+. Or if 41
Kh1 at once then Rf1+ and mate next move.} 0-1
