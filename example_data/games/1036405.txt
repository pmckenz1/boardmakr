10. Ba3 Be6 {So far everything is book. It has always been the
opinion that Black, although two Pawns ahead, will not be able
to develop his Pieces, as Castling King's side is prevented,
and the King dare not occupy the centre any length of
time. Black seemed to believe that he may get his King safely
Castled to the Queen's side ; but this game does not
corroborate such an opinion, in spite of the success which
attended that manoeuvre in this instance.} 11. Bb5

Gambit.} Qd5 12. Qa4 O-O-O 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Bc5 Bb6 15. Qa6+
{White ultimately wins the exchange by this manauvre, but at
an enormous expense. It would have been better to leave things
as they were,and to continue simply with 15 Nxe5. If then
15...Nd7 16 Nxc6 must win the exchange in favourable position;
and if 15....Ne4 16 Bxb6 cxb6 17 Qxa7 will equalise the
material forces. with the position to White's advantage.} Kb8

25. a3 c5 26. f3 Kc6 27. Rfd1 Ra8 { A Rook being very well
qualified to support advancing Pawns and to check the approach
of the hostile King, it is judicious play to avoid its
exchange for the present.} 28. Kf2 Ra4 29. Ke3 h5 {Advancing
these Pawns, which constitute the only weakness in Black's
camp, protects them against any possible attack of the Rooks
or King.} 30. Kd2 b4 31. axb4 Rxb4 32. Rdb1 Rxb1 {Now it is
just as well to simplify, two united passed Pawns with the
support of the King and Bishop being more than a match for
King and Rook. Black need only take care to leave the passed
Pawns as much as possible on the colour not dominated by the
Bishop-i.e. on black squares.} 33. Rxb1 b5 34. Ra1 b4 35. Kc2

{Threatening 13 Bf5+ 45 g4 would be answered by Kxf3. White is
therefore perfectly helpless.} 0-1
