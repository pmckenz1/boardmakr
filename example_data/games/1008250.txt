1. Nf3 {Notes by Alekhine} f5 2. e4 {An interesting gambit,
acceptance of which would lead Black into dangerous situations
after 2...fxe4 3 Ng5 Nf6 (or d5) 4 d3 exd3 5 Bxd3, etc. As
Black plays, his weakness on the e-file is without
compensation, since the open f-file is unimportant. Black's
1st move is not to be recommended.} d6 3. exf5 Bxf5 4. d4 Nf6
5. Bd3 {Another idea was 5 Bc4 in order to provoke d5. But the
method actually adopted keeps the advantage.} Qd7 6. c4 g6
7. Nc3 Bg7 8. O-O O-O 9. Re1 Bg4 {As 9...Nc6 10 d5 would be
inconvenient to Black because of his weakness at e6, he is
already practically obliged to yield his opponent the
advantage of the two bishops in order to mobilise his queen's
rook.} 10. h3 {? A tactical mistake, which should give Black a
good move. The right line was 10 Be2 (if) Nc6 11 d5 Bxf3 12
Bxf3 Ne5 13 Be2; Black would not have the important move
...Nh5.} Bxf3 11. Qxf3 Nc6 12. d5 Ne5 13. Qd1 Rae8 {? By
13...Nh5 Black could ("per nefas"!) get a strong initiative,
e.g., 14 Be2 Nf4 15 Bxf4 Rxf4 16 g3 Rd4, etc.} 14. Be2 {!} e6
15. f4 {There was no hurry for this move. 15 Be3 instead would
keep up the pressure without weakening the position in the
middle.} Nf7 16. Qb3 e5 {? The sacrifice is neither necessary
nor correct. The simplest course was ...c6 with fighting
chances.} 17. Qxb7 exf4 18. Bxf4 Rb8 19. Qxa7 Rxb2 20. Qa3
Rbb8 21. Rf1 {White only needs now to concentrate his pieces
and then to advance his passed pawn.} Ra8 22. Qb3 Qe7 23. Rae1
Ne5 24. Qc2 Rfe8 25. Nb5 Nf7 26. Kh2 Qd7 27. a4 {This should
be the beginning of the end.} Re7 28. Bd3 {? Again White
forgets the possibility of ...Nh5, but this time Black takes
advantage of the blunder. After 28 Bf3 the win would be quite
easy.} Rxe1 29. Rxe1 Nh5 30. g3 {As the bishop can hardly be
saved from exchange (e.g., 30 Be3 Be5+ 31 Kg1 Nf4, etc.) he
wishes to at least control the square e5. But this compromises
his king position.} Nxf4 31. gxf4 Bh6 32. Re4 Qd8 33. Nd4 {The
knight was well enough posted for the moment. After 33 Kg3!
Black would still be in difficulties, for 33...Qf6 could be
met by 34 Nxc7.} Qf6 34. Ne6 Rb8 {Now, as the result of the
White knight's manoeuver, Black's rook is suddenly free, and
his activity soon forces White to look for salvation by
simplifying at all costs.} 35. Qg2 Rb2 36. Be2 Ra2 37. Qg4 Qf5
{! After his opponent's mistake on the 28th move
Dr. Tartakover has exploited all of the possibilities of the
position. White must now exchange, as the delay 38 Qf3 Ne5!
would not help.} 38. Qxf5 gxf5 39. Re3 Ne5 40. Rg3+ Ng6
41. Rg2 Rxa4 42. Bd3 Kf7 43. Bxf5 Nh4 44. Bc2 Rxc4 45. Rf2 Ng6
46. Kg3 1/2-1/2
