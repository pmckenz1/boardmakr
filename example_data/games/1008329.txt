5. Nc3 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. Be3 Nc6 8. Nb3 a5 {This attempt
(instead of Botvinnik's Be6) gives the game a peculiar
character, but hardly to Black's benefit. In fact, he obtains
only a shade of attack on the queen side and yields in return
to White the full control of the important square b5. White
plays the next part of the game with perfect judgement.}
9. O-O a4 10. Nd4 O-O 11. Ndb5 Be6 12. Qd2 Na5 13. b3 {This
meets the threats in the simplest way, and Black's knight will
soon have to return after a fruitless trip.} axb3 14. axb3 Qd7
{Slightly more promising was the delaying of the following
exchange by 14...Re8.} 15. Bh6 Nc6 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Rad1 Ng8
18. f4 {A misjudgement, since White has no real prospects of a
K side attack. His chances are in the center, and on the other
side of the board. He should therefore play at once 18 Nd5
Bxd5 19 exd5 Nd8 20 c4 with an obvious positional
advantage. The move selected only weakens the central
squares.} f6 19. Nd5 Bxd5 20. exd5 Nd8 21. Nd4 {And even here
the simplest 21 c4 was also the best.} Nh6 22. Bd3 Qc7
{Intending to profit by the comparative weakness of the Black
squares in his opponent's position. White's next move, giving
up command of e5 makes the task still easier.} 23. f5 Qc5
24. Be4 Nhf7 25. Rf3 {White realises that his position does
not now look promising, and takes the first opportunity to
force a perpetual check.} Ne5 26. Rg3 g5 27. h4 h6 28. hxg5
