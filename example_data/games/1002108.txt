1.f4 {Notes by Steinitz.} d5 2.e3 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.b3 {As
explained in the "Modern Chess Instructor" we, as a rule, do
not approve on principle of the early advance of any but the
two center Pawns.} c5 5.Bb2 Be7 6.Bd3 {The Bishop is not well
placed here, being subject to the attacks of the advancing
hostile Pawns on the Q side, as will be seen.} Nc6 7.O-O O-O
8.Nc3 Bd7 9.a3 a6 10.Qe1 b5 11.Qg3 c4 12.Be2 Ne8 13.bxc4 bxc4
14.Nd1 f5 {Unnecessarily furnishing the opponent with a mark
for his attack with the g-pawn and also forming a hole in the
center. Moreover Rb8 was obviously a stronger move.} 15.Ne5
Bf6 16.Qh3 Qc7 17.Nxd7 Qxd7 18.g4 Bxb2 19.Nxb2 g6 {Again Rb8
was manifestly better , for if 20.Na4 Nd4 (threatening Nxe2+)
21.exd4 Qxa4, with the superior game.} 20.gxf5 gxf5 21.Bf3 Kh8
22.Kh1 Rg8 23.Qh6 Rb8 24.Na4 Qe7 25.Rg1 Nf6 26.Nc5 {Obviously
this cannot be taken.} a5 27.d4 cxd3 28.cxd3 Nd8 29.d4 Nf7
30.Qh4 {Allowing a cleverly concealed mine to be sprung upon
him and losing a valuable Pawn in consequence.} Ne4 31.Rxg8+
{Of course if Qxe7, he is mated by Nf2+.} Rxg8 32.Qe1 Nxc5
33.dxc5 Qxc5 {White forfeited on time. Black had evidently the
best of the game anyhow, with a Pawn ahead and having repelled
the adverse attack.} 0-1
