5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 O-O 7. Rc1 c6 8. Bd3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5
10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 {Dr.Euwe seems to like this invention of
mine, which I, on the contrary, no longer adopt, chiefly
because of he possibility of the Capablanca defence 11...Nd5f6
followed by ...Qb4+, which leads to a comparatively easy
draw.} N5f6 12. Ng3 c5 {But this is, I think more risky than
the queen check, or even Lasker's move ...e5. White could play
now 13 e4 and if ...cxd4 either 14 e5 (...Qb4+ 15 Qd2 Qxd2+ 16
Kxd2 Ng4 17 Rhf1 followed by h3) or - even simpler - 14 Qxd4
Qb4+ 15 Ke2 followed by Rhd1 and after the exchange of queens
White's prospects for the end-game would be excellent.}
13. O-O a6 14. Ne5 {At this moment 14 e4 would be less
promising , as Black could protect himself against e5 by
playing ...b5 and ...Bb7, keeping command over d5.} cxd4 {This
opening-up of the central files looks rather risky, but, as
Black's next excellent move shows, was very corrected
calculated.} 15. exd4 Qd6 {Protecting the squares c7, c6, and
d5.} 16. Qe2 b5 {Not ...Qxd4 because of 17 Nxf7! Rxf7 18 Bxe6
(18 Qxe6? Ne5!) followed by Rfd1 with a winning position for
White.} 17. Bb3 Bb7 18. Rfd1 Rac8 {This possible occupation of
the open file has also to be carefully calculated.}19. Rxc8
Rxc8 {The champion here offered a draw, which was naturally
accepted as Black saw that it could be forced by 20 Nf5 exf5
21 Nxf7 Qc7 22 Qe7 Nb6 23 Nh6+, etc. But White would not have
had any winning chances in this variation.} 1/2-1/2
