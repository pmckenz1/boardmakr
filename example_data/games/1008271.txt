1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 e6 {Dr. Euwe
prefers Bf5 introduced by me in my game against Colle, San
Remo, 1930.} 4. Nbd2 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. O-O O-O
8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e4 Qc7 10. Qe2 Re8 {the game Gilg-Alekhine,
Kecskmet, 1927, had the continuation 10...Bd6 11 Re1 Ng4 (in
order to control e5) with about even chances. With the risky
Re1 Dr. Lasker probably hopes to obtain more.} 11. e5 Nd7
12. Re1 {? Instead of this superficial move, which allows a
successful counter-attack in the center, White should play 12
Nb3 Bb6 13 Bf4 and if f6 then 14 Re1 thus keeping control over
the important e5 square. It would be difficult for Black in
that case to find a suitable line of development.} f6 13. Ng5
{This leads to lines very favourable to Black. the variation
13 exf6 Nxf6 14 b4 Bd6 was not very pleasant either. But by 13
b4 Bb6 14 exf6 Nxf6 15 b5 followed eventually by c4 White
could have complicated the situation in a way not too
unpromising for himself.} Qxe5 {! As will appear this is
perfectly convincing. White probably hoped for 13...fxg5 14
Qh5 g6 15 Bxg6 with a draw.} 14. Bxh7+ Kf8 15. Qxe5 {? After
this the bishop at h7 is in danger beyond a hope of
salvation. Necessary was 15 Ngf3 though after Qxe2 or Qh5
Black would still keep an appreciable positional advantage.}
Ndxe5 16. b4 {White must be glad now to be able to save a
piece at the price of a pawn.} Bd6 {After Bb6 17 b5 Black
would have to reckon with a possibility of Ba3+ from White.}
17. Ngf3 g6 18. Nh4 Kg7 19. f4 Kxh7 20. fxe5 Nxe5 {Black has
now not only a material surplus, but also a far superior
position - a strong center, a pair of bishops. It is therefore
rather surprising that the technical realisation of these
advantages takes so long from this point. White tries to
defend his game with great determination; but he is fighting a
lost cause.} 21. Nhf3 Bd7 22. Nxe5 Bxe5 23. Bb2 Rac8 24. Re3
Bf4 {This leads to a simple exchange; but after all this is
what Black needs in the circumstances.} 25. Rd3 Bb5 26. Rh3+
Kg7 27. a4 Bc4 28. Nxc4 Rxc4 29. Rd1 Be5 30. a5 Rec8 31. Re1
R8c6 32. Kf1 g5 33. Kg1 g4 34. Rh4 Rc8 {In order to force a
further exchange.} 35. g3 Rh8 36. Rxh8 Kxh8 37. Kg2 Kg7
38. Kf2 Kf7 39. Ke3 Ke7 40. Re2 Re4+ {Forcing the exchange of
the last pair of rooks; an effective, but rather monotonous
technical process.} 41. Kd3 Rxe2 42. Kxe2 Kd6 43. Kd3 Kc6
44. Bc1 Kb5 45. Be3 a6 46. Bh6 f5 47. Bg5 Bg7 0-1
