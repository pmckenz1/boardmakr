1.f4 {Notes by Blackburne} e5 2.fxe5 d6 3.exd6 Bxd6 4.g3 {One
of Bird's innovations, but not so strong as the usual move
Nf3.} f5 {h5 may also be played with advantage.} 5.d3 Nf6 6.c3
Nc6 7.Bg2 Ne5 8.Nd2 Qe7 9.Nf1 Bd7 10.Bf4 {Perhaps White is
right in not taking the b-pawn, as it would lose time, and
still further weaken his position.} O-O 11.Bxe5 Bxe5 12.Qc2
Kh8 13.Bf3 {Castling would certainly have been better, but
even then his position would not be easy.} Rab8 14.Qd2 Rfe8
15.h3 {White's last two moves have not in anyway improved his
position; if anything, the reverse.} Qd6 16.Kf2 c5 17.e3 Bb5
{An awkward move to parry, and there does not appear any
better defence than the one selected.} 18.Rd1 Rbd8 19.c4 Bc6
20.Qe2 b5 21.b3 bxc4 22.bxc4 Ba4 23.Rb1 Rb8 24.Nd2 {White's
position is now hopeless. Mr. Lasker's play throughout the
whole of this game is characterised by his usual correctness
and force, but who would recognise Mr. Bird's play? He
evidently was out of form this day, or it may be this opening
is not suited to his attacking style.} Bxg3+ 25.Kg2 Bh4 26.Rh2
