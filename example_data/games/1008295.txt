1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 {? A weak
continuation, which has not even the advantage of novelty. If
Dr. Tartakower thought to take his opponent by surprise he was
mistaken, as Dr. Euwe knew the variation - if not before -
from his game with Colle, Hastings, 1930-31, in which there
followed 4 cxd5 Nxd4 5 e3 Nf5 6 Nf3 Bd6 7 e4 Nfe7.} 4. cxd5
Nxd4 5. e3 Nf5 6. e4 Nd6 7. Nf3 Bg4 {Comparatively better was
f6 at once as the White Q will be extremely well placed at
b3.} 8. Qa4+ Bd7 9. Qb3 f6 10. Be3 {White has now a welcome
object of attack in Black's c-pawn.} Ne7 11. Rc1 Nec8 {Another
possible plan was c6 followed by g6 and Bg7. But White would
have no difficulty in any case in maintaining his advantage in
space.} 12. Bd3 Be7 13. O-O O-O 14. Nb5 {Aiming at the
possession of two bishops, in an anticipation of a long
positional struggle.} Bxb5 15. Bxb5 Nxb5 {? I am almost
inclined to think that Dr. Tartakower simply overlooked the
discovered check! Otherwise the move is hardly to be
explained, as the immediate disastrous consequences are only
too obvious. The right course was 15...Nf7 followed by Ncd6
with possibilities of a steady fefence.} 16. d6+ Rf7 17. dxe7
Qd7 {After 17...Qe8 18 a4 Nbd6 19 Rxc7 Nxe7 20 Bc5 White has
an easy win.} 18. Rfd1 Ncd6 19. a4 Nd4 20. Bxd4 exd4 21. e5 {!
Winning the exchange, with the better position.} fxe5 22. Nxe5
Qxe7 23. Nxf7 Nxf7 24. Qxb7 Rd8 25. Rxc7 Qe6 26. Re7 Qf6
27. Qd7 Rf8 28. Re8 {After 28 Rxd4 Black (in spite of his
optimism) would probably have resigned.} Nd6 29. Rxf8+ Kxf8
30. Rd3 Qe5 31. Kf1 h5 32. Qxa7 Nf5 33. Qd7 g6 34. Rb3 Qf4
35. g3 Qc1+ 36. Kg2 Ne3+ 37. Kh3 Qf1+ 38. Kh4 Nf5+ 39. Kg5
Qc1+ 40. Kf6 1-0
