1. c4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} Nf6 2. d4 e6 3. Nf3 c5 4. d5 d6
5. Nc3 exd5 6. cxd5 g6 7. Nd2 {To establish at c4.} Nbd7
8. Nc4 Nb6 9. e4 Bg7 10. Ne3 {Planning a4-a5 and to post the
knight anew at c4. Black would have done better to exchange
knights on his ninth move. White now gets the advantage.} O-O
11. Bd3 Nh5 12. O-O Be5 13. a4 Nf4 14. a5 Nd7 15. Nc4 Nxd3
16. Qxd3 f5 17. exf5 Rxf5 18. f4 {The prelude to a complicated
attacking operation which was the more unexpected since Ne4
gave a good game without any effort. But for once I wanted to
go in for a combination.} Bd4+ 19. Be3 Bxc3 20. Qxc3 Nf6
21. Qb3 {! White gets compensation for the d-pawn. Note,
'inter alia' that Black's queen-side is difficult to develop.}
Rxd5 {The answer to ...Nxd5 would have been Rae1!! for ...Be6
would have been prevented because of Bxc5. Black would then
have been quite helpless, and White could have won by, e.g.,
Bd2 followed by the doubling of the rooks on the e-file.}
22. f5 {!} gxf5 23. Bg5 {There is a peculiar point to this
move. If that is to say, 23...Be6, and it is with this parry
that White has above all things to reckon, then 24 Qxb7
(threatening Bxf6 and the win of a piece) Rc8 25 Rae1! and the
bishop must give up the defence of either of the rooks on
which Bxf6 would lead to the win of whichever is left
defenceless.} Rd4 24. Nb6+ c4 25. Qc3 axb6 26. Qxd4 Kg7
27. Rae1 {The quickest road to the win.} bxa5 28. Re8 {!
Violent but intelligible.} Qxe8 29. Qxf6+ Kg8 30. Bh6 1-0
