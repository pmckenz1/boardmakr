1. c4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 {If 3 e4 then
Bc5 - not Nc6 4 f4 with advantage to White as in
Alekhine-Lilienthal, Hastings, 1933-4.} Nc6 4. e3 {The
experience of the last few years has proved that the variation
4 d4 exd4 5 Nxd4 Bb4 is quite satisfactory for Black. But also
with the text move White cannot hope for any advantage.} Bb4
5. Qc2 O-O 6. Be2 Re8 7. O-O d6 {Black intends to play d5 only
after having finished his development. This is a good logical
plan, which at any rate secures him a balanced position. But
still more promising was, I think, first 7...Bf8 to prevent
the exchange of this bishop, which in the actual game became
practically forced.} 8. Ne1 {Obviously to avoid the opening of
files after 8...Bxc3 and 9...e4.} Be6 9. a3 Bxc3
{Comparatively better than 9...Ba5 10 b4 Bb6 after which he
would lose the chance of playing d5.} 10. Qxc3 a5 11. b3 Qd7
{Instead of this unnecessary preparatory move he should play
at once d5, which would either force an exchange or allow next
move d4, WITHOUT GIVING WHITE THE OPPORTUNITY (which he had in
the actual game) OF BLOCKING THE CENTER BY E4. In either case
White would have to deal with more difficult problems then
after the queen's move.} 12. d3 d5 13. Qc2 Rad8 14. Bb2
{Hoping to get rid of one of White's pair of bishops. Flohr
meets this strategical threat most energetically.} Bg4
15. cxd5 Qxd5 16. Nf3 {The further weakening of the pawn
position is in this particular case without much importance.}
Bxf3 17. gxf3 Nd7 18. Rac1 Nf8 19. Qc4 {Although the chances
are in fact about even, this premature decision, after the
interesting opening play, is regrettable.} 1/2-1/2
