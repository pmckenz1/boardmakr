1. e4 {Notes by Dr. Tarrasch} e6 2. Qe2 Nc6 {I consider the
best to be Be7. c5 is also good.} 3. Nf3 e5 {This gives an
open game.} 4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 Be7 {d5 iS stronger, with the
development of the Queen's bishop at d7, and Castles Queen’s
Rook.} 6. g3 {This development of the King’s Bishop is the
natural consequence of Qe7.} d5 7. Bg2 dxe4 {With this, Black
plays the game in the centre, and fights for a chance to get
an advantage there. Be6 was in every way stronger, followed by
Qd7, and Castles Queen Rook. The Queen’s file opened by the
exchange of the pawns is more serviceble to White than to
Black.} 8. dxe4 Bd6 {Unintelligible and at present certainly
unnecessary.} 9. Nbd2 O-O 10. Nc4 Be6 11. O-O Ne8 {Black plays
the whole game at least weakly, as is often the case when the
other plays very strongly. The Knight becomes soon stifled
here, and remains so to the end.} 12. b4 {Tchigorin gets
points of attack for himself in a clever way.} a6 13. Rd1 Qe7
14. a4 f6 15. Ba3 b5 { ? From this point Black gets into
serious difficulties. He wishes to drive the threatening
Knight, which he could hav e done before without
disadvantage. The consequence of the text move is that the
whole of Black’s Queen’s wing becomes weak, and White holds
the sole control of the open Rook’s file.} 16. axb5 axb5
17. Ne3 Rb8 {The b- Pawn must be defended.} 18. Bc1 {In order
to unmask the Rook.} Nd8 { In order to move c6 , and then to
develop with Bc7 and Nd6, which White seeks to prevent.}
19. Ra7 Nc6 20. Ra6 Nd8 21. Nd5 Qd7 {If Black takes the
Knight, the Pawn re-takes, and the cleverly isolated Pawn at
b5 is threatened with capture after Ra5 and B f1.} 22. Ne1 {In
order to get possession of c5.} c6 23. Ne3 Qb7 24. Ra1 Bc7
{Black has temporarily driven back the White forces hut,
nevertheless, he does not accomplish his planned development
of the e8 Knight.} 25. Nf5 {!} Bb6 {If Bxf5 the diagonal of
the White King’s Bishop is opened, and therewith an attack on
the Pawns. It would now be best to play g6.} 26. Be3 {In order
to guarantee the Knight an entrance at c5.} Bxe3 27. Qxe3 Rf7
28. Nd3 {The decisive, well-prepared move; Nc5 is now
threatened, followed by Rxd8 and Nxe6.} Bc8 {Ra8 would be
better, but White has then a particularly well-developed
game.} 29. Nxe5 fxe5 30. Rxd8 Be6 {Here, if ...Bxf5; 31. Rxd8
Kxd8 32 exf5 and Black has a lost game.} 31. Nd6 {The game is
an excellent example of the modern school of play.} 1-0
