1. e4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4
Nf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Nd5 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 d6 9. Nxf6+ Bxf6
10. c3 h6 {Black decides on a waiting policy.} 11. h3 Ne7
12. d4 Ng6 13. Be3 Kh7 {Black still marks time.} 14. Qd2 Be6
15. Bc2 Qe7 16. d5 {White had done better to mark time also;
the text move would have a meaning only if it were introducing
an attack against the Q side, (c4, and b4). But he intends to
operate on the K wing, and for this d5, is a bad preparation.}
Bd7 17. Kh2 Nh8 {A preventive move directed against White's
plan of Ng1, and f4.} 18. Ng1 g5 19. g3 Ng6 20. Qd1 Bg7
21. Qf3 a5 {Again preventive play. This time the possibility
of c4, and b4, is to be anticipated.} 22. Ne2 Bb5 23. a4 Bd7
{It is achieved; the White Q side has lost all momentum and
the action just mentioned, to be initiated by c4, and b4, is a
thing of the past.} 24. Rh1 {With this move White plans to
break through eventually with h4, e.g. : 24...b6 25 h4 gxh4 26
gxh4 Nxh4 27 Qh5 f5 28 Kg1, etc. But Black discovers a move,
which not only has a high preventive value, but which also has
the attribute of driving the opponent into quick action.} Qe8
{! The threat is ...Qc8; e.g. ...Qc8, h4 ...Bg4, winning a
knight. White, therefore, has no further time for preparations
and opens the battle for a breakthrough.} 25. h4 Qc8
{Threatening ...Bg4.} 26. Bd3 Bg4 27. Qg2 gxh4 28. f3 h3
29. Qf1 {The breakthrough looks like it is succeeding, for if
now ...Bd7, then g4 followed by Qxh3 with a winning attack.}
f5 {The counter-stroke, long since prepared, which decides the
battle for Black.} 30. fxg4 fxe4 31. Qxh3 exd3 {Only now can
the full effect of 28...h3 be discerned. By this move the
white queen was forced from g2 to f1 into the range of the
Black rook.} 32. Bxh6 Rh8 {This game is noteworthy on account
of the comprehensive prophylaxis employed; preventive measures
were taken against c4 and b4 as well as against f4 and later
on h4. A few words about the charachteristics of the
preventive moves selected ; the waiting policy by 10...h6 is
typical of this style of play, for waiting moves form the
beginning of all prophylactic manouvers. The fact that the
preventive move 24 ...Qe8 contains a threat at the same time
by no means detracts from its purity in a prophylaxis, in
which part of the plan is to drive the opponent to acceerated
action.} 0-1
