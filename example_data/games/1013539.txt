1. e4 {Notes by Alekhine} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 c5 4. Ngf3 Nc6
5. Bb5 {White's inclination is to maintain the tension in the
center for as long as possible. Black's next move although
fairly plausible, is nonetheless a mistake which is perhaps
decisive. Relatively better would be 5...cxd4 whereupon White
can castle since the defence of the pawn at d4 would only
create difficulties for Black.} Bd7 6. exd5 exd5 7. O-O Nxd4
{It is quite clear that Black will not manage to castle on the
king's side. Through the exchanges arising from the text move
one perceives that he is trying to prepare to castle long,
which furnishes him -although only comparatively so- with the
best chance of resistance.} 8. Nxd4 cxd4 9. Qe2+ Be7 10. Nf3
Bxb5 11. Qxb5+ Qd7 12. Qe2 O-O-O {If 12...Nf6 then, naturally,
13 Re1 and Black cannot castle.} 13. Bf4 {! Virtually forcing
the exchange of bishops and at the same time eliminating a
very useful defensive piece.} Bd6 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 15. Nxd4 Nf6
{The problem of creating an attack is not very easy to
resolve. Neither 16 Nf5 Qf4! nor 16 Nb5 Qb6 would have any
result. On the other hand Black is going to occupy the e-file
with his rooks, which will procure a counter-attacking
advantage. White's next move is the only one likely to give
him a lasting initiative.} 16. Qf3 {! This threatens 17 Nf5
and at the same time 17 Nb5.} Qb6 17. Rfd1 Rhe8 {It is clear
that the capture of the b-pawn, either now or on the following
moves, would have deadly consequences for Black.} 18. a4 Re4
19. a5 Qc5 {For example, if 19...Qxb2 then 20 c3!} 20. c3 Rde8
21. h3 {! Making use of a moment's respite to open up an
escape square for the king. This move will be found in
analogous positions in many of my games.} Qc7 22. a6 b6 23. c4
{! 23 Nb5 Qc5 24 Nxa7+? Kb8 would be premature but the move
played is very effective because against 23...dxc4 White
responds with 24 Nb5 winning the exchange.} Qc5 24. Nf5
{Threatening to win by 25 Nxg7.} Qb4 25. cxd5 Rf4 26. Qd3 Re5
27. Rac1+ Kd7 {If 27...Kb8 then 28 d6 etc.} 28. Ne3 Ne4
29. Ng4 {!} Re8 30. g3 {This wins at least the exchange since
the rook cannot retreat because of 31 Rc4. But 30 Rc4 played
immediately would constitute an error owing to 30...Nxf2!} Nc5
{This move allows an even more rapid finish.} 31. Rxc5 Re1+
32. Rxe1 Qxe1+ 33. Kg2 Rxg4 34. Qf5+ {followed by mate in a
few moves.} 1-0
