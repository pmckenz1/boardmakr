1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7
5. Bg2 d5 {In this well-known variation Black generally
develops his KB at b4 or e7. It is much more important here
first to mobilise the K side, and only develop the other wing
in accordance with the adversary's disposition.} 6. O-O Nbd7
{Even here Be7 seems preferable.} 7. cxd5 Nxd5 {Already the
decisive strategical error, which Bogoljubov exploits in a
most energetic way. exd5 was necessary with a quite possible
defence.} 8. e4 N5f6 9. e5 Nd5 10. Ng5 {! The idea of this
manoeuver is mainly to prevent Black castling on the K side,
for it is only too obvious that neither in the center nor on
the queen's wing will the Black king feel comfortable.} Be7
{He could perhaps save a tempo by playing immediately Qe7 and
if 11 Qh5 g6 12 Qh3 O-O-O. But this would hardly save his
compromised situation.} 11. Qh5 g6 12. Qh6 Bf8 13. Qh3
{Threatening Nxe6, etc.} Qe7 14. Nc3 O-O-O 15. Bd2 {White's
position is so strong that this offer of a pawn sacrifice was
absolutely unnecessary. The simple 15 Rfe1 was best.} Kb8 {As
Black has nothing to lose, he should accept the sacrifice, and
wait to see whether his opponent would find a win after
15...Nxc3 16 Bxb7+ Kxb7 18 bxc3 (not, of course 17 Qg2+ Nd5)
Nxe5 18 Qg2+ Kb8 19 Ne4 Nd7 20 a4, etc. After the indifferent
text move the game was completely lost.} 16. Nxd5 Bxd5 {exd5
would not help at all} 17. Bxd5 exd5 18. Rfe1 Rc8 {The simple
threat was 19 e6 fxe6 20 Nxe6.} 19. Rac1 Bg7 20. e6 fxe6
21. Nxe6 Nf6 {21...Qf7 22 Ng5. Or 21...Qf6 22 Bg5 Qf7 23 Nxg7,
in both cases White has an easy win.} 22. Nxc7 Qf7 23. Bf4 g5
{If 23...Kb7 27 Qf1, etc.} 24. Ne8+ 1-0
