1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7
5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Rc1 c6 8. Bd3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5
10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. O-O Nxc3 12. Rxc3 e5 13. Qc2 e4 {The
alternative 13...exd4 14.exd4 is not without danger for Black,
for instance: 14...Nf6 15.Re1 Qd6 16.Ng5 h6 (or ...Qf4 17.Nxf7
and wins as in the game Lowenfisch vs. Riumin, Moscow 1935)
17.Nxf7 Rxf7 18.Qb3 and wins. (Dr Alkhine vs. Petersen, Orebro
1935). But by playing in this variation 14...Nb6 (instead of
...Nf6) Black still seems to have an adequate defence.}
14. Nd2 Nf6 15. a3 {Too slow. The correct move, after which
White remains with a slight advantage is Bb3 with the idea of
answering ...Bf5 with f4 and eventually playing Rc5. By this
continuation Black could hardly avoid moving the Knight to d5
and the consequent exchange, which in the majority of cases
secures White the contrpl of the c-file.} Bf5 16. Rc1 {As
White cannot be sure in this position that he will need this
Rook at c1 and as he intends to play f4 anyhow, he should play
that move prior to the Rook move.} Rad8 17. b4 h5 {A good
positional move which would be useful, for instance if White
should play 18.b5 thus allowing a K-side attack after
18...cxb5 19.Bxb5 Nd5 followed by Qg5, etc.} 18. f4 g6 19. Qb3
Rd7 {! In expectation of the following reply. Otherwise he
could improve his game by the simple 19...Kg7.} 20. b5 {? This
advance must be based on a miscalculation. Agood move was
20.Nf1 after which the issue would still be uncertain.} c5
21. Qa4 {Or 21.d5 Rfd8 simply winning a Pawn. This was the
object of 19...Rd7.} cxd4 22. exd4 Qd6 23. Nb3 {Now all the
White pieces are concentrated without effect on the Q-side and
the King's position becomes very exposed.} Qxf4 24. Rf1 Qd6
25. Qxa7 {A meagre satisfaction, for the fight will be decided
by the positional, not the material, advantage.} b6 26. Qa4
Rc7 {Threatening 27...Nd5} 27. Rg3 Ng4 {!} 28. Be2 Nxh2 {! A
well played game by Dr. Vidmar.} 0-1
