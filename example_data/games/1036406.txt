1. d4 {Notes by H. N. Pillsbury} d5 2. Nf3 Bg4 3. e3 {The more
aggressive c4 is mostly preferred.} e6 4. Be2 Nd7 5. b3 Ngf6
6. Bb2 Bd6 7. Nbd2 c6 {This move might at any rate be
reserved, and the sequel shows that at least one move is lost,
since four moves later it is advanced to the fourth. Castling
at once seems preferable.} 8. Ne5 {The 'Stonewall' formation
which White obtains now is not very powerful without the aid
of the King's Bishop at d3 for attacking purposes. After 8 O-O
O-O 9 c4 Qe7 10 Re1, White evidently did not like Black's
rejoinder of e5, but continue, 11 dxe5 Nxe5 12 Nxe5 Bxe2 13
Nxc6 winning at least a Pawn. Or should Black in the foregoing
continue 10...Re8 then 11 Qc2 e5 12 dxe5 Nxe5 13 Nxe5 Bxe5 14
Bxe5 Qxe5 15 Bxg4 Nxg4 16 Nf3, with a good game, as Black will
either have to submit to an isolated d-Pawn, or allow White to
gain time to develop his Rooks on the Queen's file. All other
variations in the foregoing appear to yield White at least an
equal position.} Bxe2 9. Qxe2 O-O 10. f4 {e4 here seems quite
feasible for White.} Rc8 11. O-O c5 12. Rac1 {If White
intended to attack the King by the means of Rf3 and h3, as is
usual in 'Stonewall' variation, it would be better to continue
c3 here.} cxd4 {Qa5 at once seems superior.} 13. exd4 Qa5
14. Nd3 Ba3 15. Bxa3 Qxa3 16. c4 b6 17. g4 {White's d-pawn is
the weak spot in his position, and Black threatens anyhow
Qd6. There was no necessity for such a suicidal move as the
text, however, and it would seem that 17 b4 (threatening c5)
dxc4 18 Nxc4 Qa4 19 Nd6 Rxc1 20 Rxc1 Nd5 21 Qb2 would give
White a slight advantage.} Qd6 {Winning at least a Pawn.}
18. Ne5 dxc4 19. Rxc4 b5 {This White apparently overlooked.}
20. Rxc8 Qxd4+ 21. Kh1 Rxc8 22. Ndf3 {Desperate, but there is
nothing to be done.} Qxf4 23. Nxd7 Nxd7 24. Qxb5 Nf6 25. Ng5
Qc7 {Black can safely take the g-pawn with Queen, for if 26
Rg1 then Qd4 or if 26 Nxf7 Qe4+ 27 Kg1 Rc2 winning easily.}
26. Nxf7 {Of course a final error overlooking that if ...Qxf7
27 g5 Qd7 retaining the piece, but his game was lost anyway.}
Qxf7 27. Qe5 Qd7 28. Re1 Qd5+ 29. Qxd5 exd5 30. Re7 Rc1+ 0-1
