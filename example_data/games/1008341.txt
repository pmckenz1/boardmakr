1. f4 {Notes by Alekhine} e5 2. fxe5 d6 3. exd6 Bxd6 4. Nf3 g5
{The Lasker Attack (Bird-Lasker, 2nd match-game, 1892) leads
to lively situations if White avoids, as in the present game,
the exchange variation : 5 d4 g4 6 Ne5 Bxe5 7 dxe5 Qxd1+ etc.}
5. d4 g4 6. Ng5 {If Black replies ...f5 then 7 e4 h6 8 Nh3
sacrificing a piece for an interesting attack. After Black's
actual move White should keep his superiority without any
sacrifices.} Qe7 7. Qd3 {! Threatening 8 Ne4 and preparing
also for h3.} f5 8. h3 Nc6 9. hxg4 {9 c3 was also to be
considered, but the text move is keener and better.} Nb4
10. Qb3 f4 11. Bd2 {? A tame move which spoils the whole
effect of the energetic opening play. Logical was 11 Rxh7!
Rxh7 (Qxg5 12 Qf7+ followed by 13 Rxh8 and wins) 12 Qxg8+ Kd7
13 Nxh7 Nxc2+ 14 Kd1 Nxa1! 15 e4! fxe3 16 Bxe3 with an
overwhelming attack, as Black must be mated or lose his queen
if he takes the bishop (16...Qxe3 17 Nf6+, etc.). After the
exchanges in the text Black gets ample compensation for his
slight material inferiority.} Nxc2+ 12. Qxc2 Qxg5 13. Nc3 {If
13 Rxh7 then simply rxh7 (not Bf5 14 Qa4+) 17 Qxh7 Bxg4 with a
promising position.} Nf6 14. Ne4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4+ Qe7 16. Qf3
{16 Qxe7+ Kxe7 17 Bc3 Bxg4 18 d5 h5 19 Bxh8 Rxh8 gives Black a
splendid game. White's bishop being imprisoned.} Be6 17. Qxb7
{Not merely for the sake of a pawn but also tp prevent O-O-O.}
O-O 18. Qf3 Qg7 19. Bc3 Bxg4 20. Qd5+ Kh8 21. O-O-O Rae8
22. Rd3 {The only possible attempt to bring the king bishop to
life; but without the opponent's help it certainly could not
succeed.} Bf5 23. Rf3 Be4 {Why such a hurry? After Re7 for
instance, White would be without useful moves.} 24. Qh5 Bxf3
{? So false an appreciation of the position by a player of
Winter's experience can only be due to shortage of time. By
24... c6 25 Rfh3 (d5 26 Be5) Rf7 followed by Bd5 he could
still keep up a tremendous pressure. The "win" of the
exchange, on the contrary, completely changes the aspect of
the game in his opponent's favour.} 25. exf3 Re3 26. Bc4 Rfe8
27. Bb3 R8e7 28. Qf5 c5 {? A last error. But also after
28...Re8 29 Bc2 his position would remain very difficult.}
29. Rxh7+ Qxh7 30. Qf8+ 1-0
