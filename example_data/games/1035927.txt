1.d4 {Notes by Schiffers.} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c6 4.e3 f5 {Black
has formed the so-called ‘stone wall'. It is well known that
formerly Dr. Tarrasch did not approve of this opening.} 5.Nf3
Bd6 6.c5 {This is hardly ever good; on the approach of White’s
Pawns, Black blocks up the game on the Queen’s side and
generally obtains an opportunity for attacking on the other
wing.} Bc7 7.b4 Nd7 8.Bb2 Qe7 {Apparently loses time.} 9.b5
Qf6 10.a4 Ne7 11.a5 a6 12.bxa6 bxa6 13.Qd2 {In order to defend
the a-pawn after Na4, White should have first brought out his
White Bishop and Castled on the King’s side.} e5 {Black had
gradually prepared this move, and now obtains the attack.}
14.Na4 e4 15.Ng1 f4 16.Nb6 fxe3 17.fxe3 O-O 18.O-O-O
{Dangerous, but necessary; Nh3 would be no better. White has
made too many moves on the Queen’s side, and thus left the
King’s side undeveloped. See note 2.} Rb8 19.Ne2 Nf5 20.Kc2 {
Black threatened to capture the e-pawn with the Knight if the
White Knight leaves e2.} Qh6 21.Bc1 Nf6 22.g3 Ng4 23.Re1
{White cannot save the game; his forces are completely
disorganised.} Nfxe3+ 24.Kb1 Qg6 25.Nf4 Bxf4 26.gxf4 Nxf1
27.Rexf1 e3 28.f5 exd2 29.fxg6 Bf5+ 30.Ka2 dxc1=Q 0-1
