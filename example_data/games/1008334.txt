1. e4 {Notes by Alekhine} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6
5. Bxc6+ bxc6 6. d4 f6 {I think that this, a logical sequence
to Black's 4th move, is one of the most promising defences
against the Lopez, in which the chances of the two sides may
be considered about even. An interesting idea instead of
White's 5th move is 5 c4.} 7. Be3 {With the object of
answering g6 with 8 Qd2 followed eventually with Bh6. But
Black has a much easier line of development.} Ne7 8. Nc3 Ng6
9. Qd2 {If 9 h4 then simply exd4 followed by Ne5. The knight
would not be dislodged from its central square by f4 as the g4
square would remain weak. But 9 Qe2 offered better prospects
than the text move.} Be6 {With the obvious intention of
playing d5.} 10. b3 {? This can be considered in a higher
sense as the losing move, although White need not actually
lose material after it. The emancipating 10...d5 should be
prevented by 10 Rd1 after which the real fight would begin.}
d5 {!} 11. O-O {Giving up at least a pawn, without the
slightest compensation. This could be avoided by 11 exd5 cxd5
12 Na4 e4 13 Ng1 but White's position would remain bad
enough.} dxe4 12. Nxe4 Bd5 13. Ng3 {The knight cannot be
protected on account of 13...f5, etc.} Bxf3 14. gxf3 Nh4 {!
Securing a decisive material advantage as 15 Qe2 would be met
by Qd5 16 Ne4 Qe6! (less convincing would be 16...exd4 17
Nxf6+ gxf6 18 Bg5+) and ....Qh3. The rest of the game is
merely a matter of technique.} 15. Qd3 Nxf3+ 16. Kh1 Nxd4
17. Qe4 Qd5 {By trying to keep the two extra pawns Black will
eventually meet with difficulties.} 18. Qxd5 cxd5 19. Bxd4
exd4 20. Rad1 Bc5 {If ...c5 White would also win a pawn by 21
c3, etc.} 21. Nf5 Kf7 22. Nxd4 Rhe8 {Besides his material
superiority Black has also the better position - the only open
file, bishop vs. knight, and a more active king.} 23. c3 Re5
24. Rd3 Rae8 25. a4 {? This creates a new weakness in the
b-file, which Black exploits in a very convincing manner. A
longer resistance was possible after 25 Kg2.} Bxd4 26. Rxd4
{26 cxd4 Re1 27 Kg2 Rxf1 28 Kxf1 Ke7 29 Rc3 Kd6 30 Rc5 Rb8 31
Ra5 Rb6 left White helpless.} c5 27. Rd2 Rb8 28. Rb1 a5
29. Kg2 Ke6 30. Rc2 Kd6 31. f3 g5 32. Kg3 h5 33. h4 {Otherwise
Black would win by c4 followed by Re3.} gxh4+ 34. Kxh4 Re3
35. Kg3 {35 Kxh5 Rg8 would put White's king in a mating net.}
c4 {! Winning another pawn.} 36. b4 axb4 37. cxb4 Rb3 {A
simple but instructive rook endgame.} 0-1
