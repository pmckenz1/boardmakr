1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 Bxc3+
5. bxc3 O-O {As the continuation shows, this attempt to meet
White's two bishops by simple developing moves is not quite
sufficient. Instead, Black may adopt one of the following
three plans : (a) 5...b6 in order to fight against White's e4;
(b) 5...c5 in order to fix White's doubled pawns; or (c)
5...d6 in order to play as soon as possible e5.} 6. Qc2 d5
{After this White has no more trouble concerning the two
c-pawns, while his pleasure - the two bishops - still
remains.} 7. Bg5 c5 8. e3 cxd4 {Hoping to be able to play
e5. White, however, defeats the plan.} 9. exd4 Nc6 10. Nf3 Re8
11. Ne5 {! The right move, which mechanically prevents the
e-pawn's advance - possible, for instance, even after 11 Bd3.}
dxc4 {Logical but not quite sufficient.} 12. Nxc6 {The crisis
of the game. Instead of improving his position by the obvious
12 f4, White allows Black to carry out his intention. He has
no reason to fear 12 f4 Nxd4. In fact after 13 cxd4 Qxd4 14
Rd1 Qe3+ 15 Be2 Ne4 16 Ng4 white would easily maintain his
advantage.} bxc6 13. Bxc4 h6 {He could also play at once e5,
but without appreciable profit, e.g., 14 O-O exd4 15 Rad1 c5
16 cxd4 cxd4 17 Be3, etc.} 14. Bd2 {This, as will soon appear,
is an indirect protection of the d-pawn.} e5 15. O-O exd4
16. cxd4 Be6 {If ...Qxd4 then 17 Bxh6! is to White's advantage
(e.g. if 17...gxh6 18 Qg6+).} 17. Ba6 {White tries to
complicate matters, but without success, as the two weaknesses
- White's d-pawn and Black's c-pawn - are about equal
inconveniences. The position comes down therefore in a few
moves to perfect balance.} Qb6 18. Qd3 Rad8 19. Be3 Nd5
20. Bc4 {He sees that 20 Rab1 Bf5 would be to the adversary's
advantage, and therefore allows the position to be
liquidated.} Nxe3 21. fxe3 Bxc4 22. Qxc4 Rxe3 23. Qxf7+ Kh8
24. Rf4 Rb3 25. h3 1/2-1/2
