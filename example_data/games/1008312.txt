1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7
5. e3 Nbd7 6. Nf3 {White can avoid the following
simplification by playing 6.Rc1 c6 7.Bd3; but this is hardly
necessary, for in the following endgame the chances of the
first player will be better on account of the greater freedom
in the center and the open b-file.} Ne4 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 8. Qc2 c6
9. Nxe4 dxe4 10. Qxe4 Qb4+ 11. Nd2 Qxb2 12. Qb1 {After 12.Rb1,
Black would do better not to take the a-pawn because of the
possible attack commencing by Bd3, Ke2, etc. but play 12...Qc3
after which White could hardly avoid the exchange of Queens.}
Qc3 {Black prefers to delay the exchange for one move in order
to have the opponent's Rook at c1 and not b1.} 13. Qc1 Qxc1+
14. Rxc1 c5 {After 14...e5 15.Nf3 the opening of the e-file
would be in White's favor.} 15. g3 {A good idea, as the Bishop
will have excellent prospects on the long diagonal. Still in
the following White omits to take full profit of the
positional advantage.} Ke7 16. Bg2 Rd8 17. Ke2 {Here was, for
instance, the right moment to force by 17.Nb3 the Pawn
exchange in the middle, as after 17...cxd4 18.exd4 White could
even Castle in order to occupy promptly the central files with
his Rooks. After the move selected Black succeeds through
accurate defence in avoiding further trouble.} Rb8 {Now he
will be able to answer Nb3 with ...b6.} 18. Rc3 cxd4 {Rather
surprising, but well calculated. Black has just time to
develop his Bishop.} 19. exd4 Nf6 20. Nf3 Bd7 21. Ne5 Be8
22. Ke3 Nd7 23. Ra3 {No more promising was 23.f4 f6 etc.} Nxe5
24. dxe5 a6 25. Rb1 {White's last hope to get some advantage
but the following move destroys such illusions.} b5 {Forcing a
speedy liquidation.} 26. Rxa6 bxc4 27. Ra7+ Kf8 28. Rxb8 Rxb8
29. Rc7 Rb2 1/2-1/2
