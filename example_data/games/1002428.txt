1.e4 {Notes by Steinitz.} e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4
c5 6.dxc5 Nc6 {A good idea and much superior to 6...Bxc5, to
which White would reply 7.Qg4 as in a game between the editor
and Senor Vasquez.} 7.a3 {We think the best plan to maintain a
slight advantage is 7.Be3 Bxc5 8.Bxc5 Nxc5 10.Nf3 etc.} Bxc5
8.Qg4 O-O 9.Bd3 {Nf3 was, we believe, preferable.} f5 10.Qh3
Bxg1 11.Rxg1 Nc5 {This and the preceeding exchange are well
played. Black now secures either another exchange of an
important hostile attacking piece, or else, should White
retreat Be2, Black obtains a strong entrance with the Knight
at b4.} 12.Bd2 Nxd3+ 13.Qxd3 a6 {A necessary precaution now,
for he cannot afford to let the adverse Knight in at b4.}
14.O-O-O b5 15.Ne2 Bd7 16.g4 fxg4 17.Rxg4 Be8 {With this well
conceived retreat Black soon secures himself on the K side
against any kind of assault.} 18.Qg3 Bg6 19.Be3 Ne7 20.Nd4
{Clearly playing at once for a draw, and for fair reasons. If
Mr Weiss had lost this game, he would not have been sure even
of the second prize, for he would have tied for second and
third with Mr Gunsberg. By drawing this game he secured the
tie for first and second prizes, and as the position gave
hardly any promise for more than a draw. Mr Weiss was clearly
justified in forcing that result as early as possible.} Nf5
