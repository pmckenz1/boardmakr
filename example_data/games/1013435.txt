1. e4 {Notes by Alekhine After the moves 1 e4 c6 2 Nc3 d5 3
Nf3 dxe4 4 Nxe4 one arrives at a position analagous to the
normal variation (with 2 d4) and Black might be tempted to
continue in the same way, that is to say 4...Bf5. In reality
this move is an important loss of time here and frequently
leads to swift catas trophe.} c6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Nxe4
Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 {? The lesser evil would be 5...Bg4.} 6. h4 h6
7. Ne5 {! Herein lies the difference with the variation whivh
begins by 2 d4: White can at once attack the bishop, which can
choose only between the square h7 and an exchange which
weakens the pawn structure in a decisve way.} Nd7 8. Nxg6 fxg6
9. d4 {! This prevents 9...Ne5.} e5 10. Qg4 Qf6 11. Be3 {! The
best. Less effective would have been 11Bg5 Qf7 etc. But if
Black castles then 12 Bg5! is played.} Ne7 {? Black should not
lose so quickly, although strategically and in the long run
his game could not be defended.} 12. Ne4 {Winning the queen.}
