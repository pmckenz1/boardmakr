1. e4 {Annotation by Alexander Alekhine.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3
Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. h4 {This interesting attack was
introduced by me at Mannheim in 1914 and since then has been
incorporated into master praxis.} c5 {One of the numerous
replies which are possibe but which do not present White with
any difficulties Much more is promising is 6...f6.} 7. Bxe7
Kxe7 {if 7...Qxe7 there follows 8 Nb5.} 8. Qg4 Kf8 9. Nf3 Nc6
{With the offer of an exchange of queens by 9...cxd4 10 Qxd4
Qb6 Black could obtain approxmate compensation.} 10. dxc5 Nxc5
{sharper would have been 10...Ndxe5 11 Nxe5 Nxe5 12 Qg3 f6.}
11. O-O-O a6 12. Rh3 h6 {Usually Black does not worry about
the king's side and seeks counter play on the queen's
flank. This move is not corrected and, as will be seen, White
manages to take possesion of and exploit the strong strategic
point d4. The opportune move would have been 12... Qc7 13 Rg3
f6 14 exf6 gxf6 with changes of a counter of attack.} 13. Rg3
Rg8 14. Bd3 Nxd3+ 15. Rxd3 Qb6 16. Rd2 Qc7 17. Qf4 Bd7 18. Ne2
Rc8 19. Ned4 Na5 20. Rd3 Nc4 21. b3 Qa5 {A blow which is based
on a tactical calculation. With ...Na5-c6 Black would have
been able to defend himself for some time but I had already
lost my taste for this position and also my confidence in the
resistance I would be able to offer.} 22. bxc4 dxc4 23. Re3 c3
{Too late I realized that 23...Qxa2 is refuted by 24 Nd2! with
the double threat of 25. Ra3 and 25 Ref3} 24. Nb3 Qa3+ 25. Kd1
a5 26. Nfd4 Ke7 27. Ref3 Be8 28. Ne2 Qb2 29. Nxc3 Rd8+ 30. Rd3
Bc6 {In case of 30...Qxc3 there would follow 31 Rxd8 attacking
the queen.} 31. Qc4 Rxd3+ 32. Rxd3 Rc8 33. Qc5+ Ke8 34. Qxa5
Bxg2 35. f3 Bf1 36. Qb5+ Kf8 37. Qxb7 Re8 38. Rd7 Kg8 39. Qc7
Rf8 40. Rd8 Rxd8+ 41. Qxd8+ Kh7 42. Kd2 {I resigned a few
moves later. Bogoljubov exploited my mistakes very well,
winning the game in elegant style.} 1-0
