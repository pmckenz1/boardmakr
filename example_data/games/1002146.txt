1.e4 {Notes by Steinitz.} e5 2.c3 d5 3.Nf3 dxe4 4.Nxe5 {4.Qa4+
Nc6, would transform the game into a position of the Ponziani
Opening which is more favorable for White than the line of
play in the text.} Qd5 5.d4 exd3 6.Nxd3 {White has now a
weakness in the center that later on becomes troublesome.} Nf6
7.Be3 Nc6 8.Nd2 Bd6 9.Qf3 O-O 10.Be2 Bf5 11.Bg5 {The waste of
a move here with this Bishop has serious consequenses. He
was,however, already on the defence and his position a little
inferior. His best plan was 11.Qxd5 Nxd5 12.Nf1.} Rfe8 12.Qxd5
Nxd5 13.Kd1 h6 14.Bh4 {Falling into a cleverly laid trap. Be3
was his only move, but ofcourse a Pawn was then lost. In view,
also, of the relative strenght of the players the adverse
victory was assured.} Rxe2 {Fine play.} 15.Kxe2 Re8+ 16.Kd1
Bxd3 17.Re1 Rxe1+ 18.Kxe1 Nf4 19.Bg3 Nxg2+ 20.Kd1 Ne5 21.Nb3

Bc4+ 33.Ke1 Bg3+ 34.Kd2 Nf2 35.Rg1 Bf4+ 36.Ke1 Nd3+ 37.Kd1 h5
38.Kc2 h4 39.Rh1 Bg3 40.Kd2 Nf2 41.Rg1 Bf4+ 42.Ke1 Nd3+ 43.Kf1
Be3 {Black's play from the fourteenth move is a good specimen
of clever tactics with two minor pieces against the Rook in
the ending, but it required no comment, as obviously the
superiority of force and of play was on his side. At this
point he wins easily, for wherever the Rook may move, a
discovered check of the Knight either at f2 or f4 will cause
its loss.} 0-1
