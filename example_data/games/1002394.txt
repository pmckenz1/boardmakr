1.e4 {Notes by Steinitz.} e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 {We notice in all
the games of this opening in which Mr Chigorin is the first
player that the Russian master prefers the old line of
continuation for White.} exd5 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Bd3 Be7 {New, but
hardly as good as the commonly played 5...Bd6.} 6.Ne5 Nc6
7.Nxc6 {This allows Black to form a good center later
on. after 7.Bb5 Bd7 8.Nxd7 Qxd7 9.O-O, we slightly prefer
White, on account of the two Bishops.} bxc6 8.O-O O-O 9.Nc3
Bg4 {We do not see any use in this, and would have much
preferred to dissolve the doubled Pawns by ...c5.} 10.f3 Bh5
11.Bf4 {Our suggestion is probably not congenial to Mr
Chigorin's style, but we have no doubt according to our
principles that Na4 followed by Be3, was his correct play; and
if he only stopped the advance of the adverse c-pawn, he was
bound to obtain the superiority in the end, on account of the
opponent's doubled c-pawn and isolated a-pawn.} c5 12.Be5 cxd4
13.Bxd4 c5 14.Be5 Bd6 15.Bxd6 Qxd6 16.Kh1 Bg6 17.b3 Rfe8
18.Bxg6 hxg6 19.Re1 {The game resolves itself into a position
which by rights ought to lead to a draw.} Rxe1+ 20.Qxe1 Re8
21.Qd2 d4 22.Na4 Nd5 23.Re1 {Much better was 23.c3 Ne3 24.Re1
followed by cxd4.} Rxe1+ 24.Qxe1 Nb4 25.Qe2 Nxa2 26.Qc4 Qe5
27.h3 {The natural and usual move in similar positions, but a
blunder in this exceptional and curious instance. g3 was the
only move to save the game, and though Black would keep a
Pawnahead even in that case, the game would most likely have
ended in a draw.} Qe1+ 28.Kh2 Nc1 {Black shrewdly grasps his
advantage. He now wins the game by force, as he threatens Ne2,
to which his opponent has no defence.} 0-1
