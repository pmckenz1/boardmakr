1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. Nf3 b6 3. e3 {More usual and
strategically safer is 3.c4 Bb7 4.g3, etc.} c5 4. c4 Bb7
5. Nc3 {The complications which could arise after 5.d5 b5,
etc. would be rather in Black's favor.} cxd4 6. exd4 e6 7. Bd3
Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. b3 {With this move, which weakens the Q-side
without any necessity, and the next one, White completely
spoils his position, which would be promising enough after
9.Bf4 followed, in case of 9...d5 by 10.Qe2,Rad1, etc.} d5
10. Be3 {? And now he should prevent ...Ne4 by playing, for
instance 10.Qe2 as 10...dxc4 would not be dangerous because of
11.Bxc4 Bxf3 12.Qxf3 Qxd4 13.Rd1. From now on Black has the
better game.} Ne4 11. Rc1 Nd7 12. Qe2 {? The aim of this move
is difficult to understand. Because of his already inferior
position he should try to simplify matters by 12.Ne5 as
12...Nxc3 13.Rxc3 Nxe5 14.dxe5 d4? would be answered by
15.Bxd4. After the Queen's move this will, of course, be
impossible.} Rc8 {Black does not hurry with ...f5 as the
opponent already has no really useful moves at his disposal.}
13. Rfd1 f5 14. Bf4 {? Directly provoking the unavoidable
K-side attack. White plays the whole game with the resignation
of a lamb under the threat of the butcher's knife.} g5 15. Be5
g4 16. Ne1 Nxe5 17. Bxe4 {17.dxe5 Qc7 etc, would not alter the
situation.} dxe4 18. dxe5 Qc7 19. Nb5 {The only way to prevent
material disadvantage.} Qxe5 20. Rd7 {The last of a series of
mistakes which loses in a few moves. After 20.Nxa7 Ra8 21.Nb5
etc. White in spite of the obvious advantage of Black's
position (the two powerful Bishops) could still put up a
stubborn resistance.} Bg5 21. Rcd1 {He may at his previous
move, have overlooked, that 21.Rxb7 Bxc1 22.Nd3 would be fatal
because of 22...Qa1.} Bc6 22. Rxa7 Rcd8 {The occupation of the
open file is absolutely decisive.} 23. h4 Rxd1 24. Qxd1 Rd8
25. Qc2 Bd2 {If now 26.Qb1 e3 27.fxe3 Qxe3+ 28.Kf1 Be4 etc.}
0-1
