1. c4 {Notes by Alekhine} c6 2. e4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 Nf6
5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nf3 e6 {It is somehat better to play this on the
sixth move, in order to be able to answer c5 with b6. After
the text move the advance of the c-pawn would offer White
excellent prospects.} 7. Bd3 {? Instead ofg which White loses
an important tempo, and allows his adversary to enter into a
quiet variation of the Queen's Gambit Accepted.} dxc4 8. Bxc4
a6 9. O-O Be7 10. Bf4 O-O 11. a3 {Preparing d5 which at this
moment would be premature, on account of the answer 11...Na5.}
b5 12. d5 exd5 {It is obvious that after 12...bxc4 13 dxc6
White's c-pawn would be stronger than Black's. Also that
12...Na5 13 Bxb5 followed by 14 d6 would be to White's
advantage.} 13. Bxd5 Bb7 14. b4 {If this move is made in order
to prevent Na5, it fails to attain its object. In fact, Black
could make the knight's move, which was in the circumstances
his simplest course. E.g., 14...Na5 15 Bxf7+ Rxf7 16 bxa5 Qxa5
17 Qb3 Bxf3 followed by Raf8.}h6 {? An important loss of
time. If he did not mean to play Na5 he should continue
14...Nxd5 15 Nxd5 Bd6 with a feasible defence.} 15. Re1 Nxd5
{? A mistake. Necessary first was 15...Rc8.} 16. Nxd5 Bg5
{Strangely enough, there is no longer a defence against the
threats of Nxe7+, Bc7, or Nc7.} 17. Bc7 Qc8 18. Nxg5 hxg5
19. Rc1 {? The game could easily have been won by 19 Qh5! If
in reply ...Qf5 then 20 Re5! Qg6 21 Rxg5 Qxh5 22 Nf6+ followed
by 23 Rxh5 mate. Or if 19...f6 then 20 Bd6 Rf7 (Rd8 21 Nb6
winning the exchange) 21 Nb6 Qd8 22 Bc5 followed by Rad1 when
black would lose through want of space.} Re8 {Now the
immediate danger is over. If 20 Rxe8+ Qxe8 21 Nb6 then Ra7 22
Qd2 f6 23 Re1 Qf7, etc.} 20. Qd3 {Still White should adopt the
variation just mentioned. After the careless move in the text
Black can force a drawn position in a few moves.} Qg4 21. Qg3
Qxg3 22. hxg3 Ne5 23. Rxe5 Rxe5 24. Bxe5 Bxd5 1/2-1/2
