1.e4 {Notes by Blackburne. This is the first game I ever
played with Professor Anderssen, the greatest German player,
and at that time in the zenith of his fame. For a novice to
offer so brilliant an expert the Muzio was like Ivanhoe
challenging Bois-Gilbert in the lists at Ashby, but we were
nothing if not daring in those days, and the cautious modern
safety-loving youth of today had not yet been evolved. It
shows what a change has come over chess during the last forty
years.} e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.O-O gxf3 6.Qxf3 Qe7
