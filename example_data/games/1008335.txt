1. e4 {Notes by Alekhine} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Be7 {If Black
does not intend to develop the bishop at c5 or b4 but to play
d6 it is better to make that move first. He would then have
the option in certain cases of developing the B in
fianchetto.} 4. d4 d6 5. h3 {Hardly necessary at the moment,
but will be useful later to keep Black's minor pieces off
g4. 5 Nc3 Bg4 6 h3 occurred in Alekhine vs. Breyer, Mannheim,
1914.} Nf6 6. Nc3 a6 {This move would prove rather harmless if
White replied simply 7 a3. As it happens, however, it leads to
an exchange which facilitates the defence.} 7. Be3 b5 8. Bd5
{Simplest as he has to consider two possibilities - 8...b4,
and 8...exd4 9 B or Nxd4 Nxd4 10 B or Nxd4 c5.} Nxd5 9. Nxd5
O-O 10. O-O Bb7 {An indirect protection of d5, in order to
prepare for f5. White prevents this project by his next move.}
11. Qd3 exd4 12. Bxd4 Nxd4 13. Nxd4 {The famous "two bishops"
will in this instance be perfectly useless, as one of them
will be necessarily be exchanged off in a very few moves.} Bf6
14. c3 Re8 15. a4 Bxd4 16. cxd4 {Not of course 16 Qxd4 on
account of c6 followed by c5.} c6 {Too optimistic. In the
ensuing blockade the superiority of the knight over the bishop
will become apparent. Much safer was 16...Bxd5 17 exd5 bxa4 18
Rxa4 Qb8 with a rather easy draw in the near future.} 17. Ne3
c5 18. d5 Qd7 19. f3 f6 20. b3 {White's plan is obvious; he
intends to free the c4 square for the knight.} Reb8 21. Rf2
Bc8 22. Rfa2 bxa4 {A sad necessity, as Bb7 would be worse, on
account of 23 axb5 axb5 24 Ra5, etc.} 23. Rxa4 Rb5 24. Nc4
Rab8 25. R4a3 Qc7 26. Qe3 Bb7 27. Qf4 Rd8 28. Kh2 Qd7 29. g4
{This is somewhat premature, and would be more effective after
29 Na5 Ba8. But even now White's prospects in the middle and
end game are superior, and he should not have stopped playing
after his opponent's next move.} Bc8 1/2-1/2
