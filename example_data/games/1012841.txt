1. d4 {Notes by A. Alekhine} Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ne4 {Less
usual, but not better than 3...Ng4 against which I have had
(excepting the Gilg game, Semmering, 1926) rather pleasant
experiences, too.} 4. Nd2 Nc5 {If 4...Bb4 then 5 Nf3 followed
by a3, in order to obtain the advantage of the two Bishops.}
5. Ngf3 Nc6 6. g3 Qe7 7. Bg2 g6 8. Nb1 {! This at first sight
surprising move is in reality perfectly logical. After Black
has clearly shown his intention to develop the King's Bishop
at g7, White has no longer to reckon with any action on the
diagonal e1-a5. There is no reason, therefore, for delay in
placing his Knight on the dominating square d5.} Nxe5 9. O-O
Nxf3+ 10. exf3 Bg7 11. Re1 Ne6 12. Nc3 O-O 13. Nd5 Qd8 14. f4
c6 {He has willy-nilly to dislodge the White Knight--thus
creating a dangerous weakness at d6--because after the
immediate 14 d6 the temporary sacrifice 15 f5, etc., would be
too dangerous for him.} 15. Nc3 d6 16. Be3 Qc7 17. Rc1 Bd7
18. Qd2 Rad8 19. Red1 Bc8 20. Ne4 Nc5 {This will be finally
refuted by the combination starting with White's 24th
move--but owing to the weakness mentioned above Black's
position was already very difficult. Unsatisfactory would be,
for instance, 20 d5 21 cxd5 Rxd5 22 Nf6+, followed by 23 Bxd5
etc., winning the exchange; or 20 ...c5 21 f5! gxf5 22 Nc3 Nd4
23 Nd5 Qb8 24 Bg5, etc. ; and after the comparatively safest
20 ...b6 White could also easily increase his advantage in
space by continuing 21 b4 etc.} 21. Nxd6 Na4 22. c5 Nxb2
23. Re1 b5 24. cxb6 {! A surprising but not very complicated
combination. The only difficulty consisted in the necessity of
foreseeing this possibility several moves before, when making
the capture 21 Nxd6.} Qxd6 25. Qxd6 Rxd6 26. bxa7 Bb7 27. Bc5
Rdd8 28. Bxf8 Kxf8 29. Bxc6 Bxc6 30. Rxc6 Ra8 {The last moves
of Black were practically forced and, his position being
absolutely hopeless, he prefers a quick end. If, instead of
this, 30 Bd4 then 31 Rd6, also winning immediately.} 31. Rb6
Rxa7 32. Rb8# 1-0
