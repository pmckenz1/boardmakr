1. f4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 Bg4 {This
development of the queen bishop is not very promising, as
black will not be able to avoid the exchange. More usual-just
the same as for White against the Dutch Defence- the king's
fianchetto.} 4. c4 e6 5. Nc3 Nbd7 {Black renounces the
opportunity to exert pressure against d4 and so relieves his
adversary of any possible worries. He should play 5...c5 and
if 6 cxd5 exd5 7 Bb5+ then Nbd7 (or even Nc3) 8 O-O Bd6, etc.,
with better prospects than he has in the actual game.} 6. cxd5
exd5 7. Be2 c6 8. O-O Bxf3 {To prevent d4 followed by Ne5. But
White has now the pair of bishops.} 9. Bxf3 Bb4 10. Qc2 O-O
11. b3 Qe7 12. Na4 {At this point, or even before, White
should have played a3, to preserve his two bishops. After the
text move the position becomes perfectly even, and neither of
the performers seems to enjoy further play.} Ba3 13. Bxa3 Qxa3
14. Rac1 Rfe8 15. Nc3 Rad8 16. Ne2 1/2-1/2
