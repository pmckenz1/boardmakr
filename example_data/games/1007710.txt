1. d4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 b6 4. Nc3 Bb7
5. Qc2 Bb4 6. a3 {This move looks very much like the loss of a
tempo. Why not 6 g3.} Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 d6 {Better than 7...Ne4 at
once, e.g. : 8 Qc2 d6 9 g3 Nd7 10 Bg2 and in view of the
threatened Ng5 Black would be forced to play the defensive and
uninviting 10...Rb8; the transition to the second phase of the
opening must not be too sudden.} 8. g3 Nbd7 9. Bg2 Qe7 10. O-O
O-O 11. b4 {Only now ids the proper time!} Ne4 12. Qc2 f5
13. Ng5 Ndf6 14. Nxe4 {Preferable would be 14 f3 Nxg5 15 Bxg5
e5 16 e3 with drawing chances.} Bxe4 15. Bxe4 Nxe4 16. f3 Nf6
17. Bb2 Rf7 {But not 17...a5 18 Bc3 and Black would only have
committed himself needlessly.} 18. Rac1 {Correct was Rf2.}
Raf8 19. Qd3 h5 20. e4 {If this were feasible, Black's
preventive scheme (Rf7 and Raf8 would have been useless. But
the move is not playable, and the f-file which he opens so
lightheartedly makes short work of his chances. A little
better would be 20 e3 though White would still be at a
disadvantage after 20...h4 21 Kg2 Nh5.} fxe4 21. fxe4 Ng4 {The
execution so kindly predicted in the preceding note now
begins.} 22. h3 Nf2 23. Qe2 Nxh3+ 24. Kh1 Qg5 25. Rxf7 Rxf7
26. Qg2 Nf2+ 27. Kg1 Qe3 {In order to understand this game as
a whole, it is necessary to grasp the connection between
Black's waiting moves (7, 17, and 18) were made, so to speak,
only so that the powerful 19...h4 should gain in
effect. Viewed in this light, the enormous power of this move
becomes clear. A victory of alternating strategy applied to
the opening.} 0-1
