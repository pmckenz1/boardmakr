1.d4 {Notes by H. N. Pillsbury} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 c5
5.e3 {In a game between Blackburne and Showalter the former
here continued Bg5.} Nc6 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Bd3 a6 8.dxc5 Bxc5
9.O-O O-O 10.Bd2 Re8 11.Rc1 Ba7 12.Ne2 {It would he better to
prevent the pinning by h3; Black has much the freer position
of Pieces, fully compensating for the isolated Pawn.} Bg4
13.Bc3 { Ng3 at once was the correct move, and would have
prevented the formation of the attack which ensues.} Ne4
14.Ng3 Nxf2 {This pretty sacrifice leads to fine
complications, but there appears to be a flaw in it.} 15.Rxf2
Rxe3 16.Nf5 {Why not simply Be2? If in answer i6...Qb6 then 17
Nd4, or if 16...Bxf3 17 Bxf3 Qb6 18 Qf1. White appears to
retain at least the exchange ahead in all variations.} Rxf3
{Black now demolishes the opposing position with a few well
chosen, timely strokes.} 17.gxf3 Bxf5 18.Bxf5 Qg5+ 19.Bg4 h5
20.Qd2 Be3 0-1
