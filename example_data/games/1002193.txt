1.e4 {Notes by Steinitz.} e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.Nf3 Bb4
5.O-O O-O 6.Bxc6 {The game is now transformed into a regular
Double Ruy Lopez, and this continuation leads to a dreary
equalization.} dxc6 7.Nxe5 Re8 8.d4 Bxc3 9.bxc3 Nxe4 10.Re1 {A
little trap that, we believe, presents the only feature of
interest in this game. If Black be tempted to answer 10...Nxc3
then 11.Qf3 Nd5 12.Qxf7+ Kh8 13.Ng6+, wins.} Bf5 11.g4 Bg6
12.Nxg6 fxg6 {On principle we generally prefer taking with a
Pawn toward the center, and therefore hxg6 was here
undoubtedly better.} 13.Qd3 Nf6 {For now he might have kept
the Knight strongly planted in the center, at least for a
time, by ...f5 if he had previously retaken with the h-pawn,
as above suggested. It would then have been somewhat
compromising for White to attempt driving away the Knight by
f3, as Black could have continued with ...Qh4.} 14.Bg5 Qd7
15.h3 Rxe1+ 16.Rxe1 Re8 17.Rxe8+ Nxe8 18.Qe4 Nd6 19.Qe2 Qe8
20.Qxe8+ Nxe8 {After the slaughter of the heavier pieces the
game drags itself tediously into a draw.} 21.f3 Kf7 22.Kf1 Ke6
23.Ke2 Kd5 24.Kd3 b5 25.Be7 a6 26.Bf8 h6 27.Bb4 Ke6 {Nd6 does
no good either for White need not capture it since Black
cannot well enter into the game by Nc4, on account of the
rejoinder Bf8.} 28.c4 Nf6 29.Bd2 g5 30.Be1 Ne8 31.Bg3 Nd6
32.c5 1/2-1/2
