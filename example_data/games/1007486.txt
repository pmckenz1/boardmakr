1. e4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 {A move
of this type requires courage - and faith in the inner meaning
of the blockade. The move gives up a tempo (non-development of
a piece) and crates a hole on d5, all this to prevent White's
d4, and so to obstruct his opponent.} 4. Bc4 d6 5. h3 Be6
6. d3 Be7 7. O-O h6 {Black is taking his time. His opponent is
short of effective moves.} 8. Nd5 {With the object of
emphasizing the strenght of d5; but as soon becomes clear,
this can be achieved only with the help of sacrifices in
material or position.} Nf6 {Mow d5 is under fire.} 9. Nh4
{White seeks to maintain it by combinative means.} Nxd5 {Bad
would be 9...Nxe4 10 dxe4 Bxh4 because of 11 f4.} 10. exd5
Bxd5 11. Nf5 {The sacrificial operation mentioned in the note
to move 8. White wins back his pawn but remains with doubled
pawns; the sacrifice therefore turns out to be positional. He
had the option of sacrifice in material by 11 Bxd5 Bxh4 12 f4
with attacking chances. All things being equal, either
sacrifice should suffice to secure a draw.} Bxc4 12. dxc4 g6
{If 12...O-O 13 Qg4 Bg5 14 h4, etc.} 13. Nxh6 Qd7 14. Qd5 Nd8
15. Be3 {If 15 Ng4 f5 16 Ne3 Ne6 followed by ...O-O-O and the
position would be summed up as follows : Black has
opportunities in the h-file, whilst any attack attempted by
White would break down against Black's compact
pawn-formation.} f5 16. Ng8 Bh4 17. g3 Qe6 18. Rad1 {The
losing move 18 gxh4 Rxg8 (not 18...Qxd5 because of Nf6+) 19
Bg5 should be enough for a draw, e.g. : 19...Qxd5 20 cxd5 Rh8
21 f4 e4 22 Rae1 followed by Re3.} Rxg8 19. gxh4 f4 {Now the
bishop cannot get to g5.} 20. Bxf4 {Or 20 Bc1 Qxd5 21 Rxd5 Nf7
with ...O-O-O and ...Rh8 and an easy win for Black.} Qxd5
21. Rxd5 exf4 22. Rxd6 Ke7 23. Rfd1 b6 24. Rd7+ Kf6 {One gets
the impression that the line of play ...c5 in connection with
...e5 which weakens d5 still is sound, for white could
maintain himself at d5 with difficulty and should, at the
most, have attained a draw.} 0-1
