1. d4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. Ne5
Bh5 5. Nxc4 {The best answer to 5 Nc3 would be 5...Nd7 and the
proud knight at e5 will be forced to declare his intentions.}
e6 6. Qb3 {Threatening both Qxb7 and Qb5+.} Nc6 7. e3 Rb8 {!
He does not hesitate in employing the rook to protect the
modest pawn!} 8. Nc3 Nf6 9. Be2 Bxe2 10. Nxe2 Bb4+ 11. Nc3 O-O
{Both sides have now completed their development, and the game
is about equal. But White's center, which is otherwise well
protected, betrays a striking measure of immobility. 'My
System', however, teaches that every immobile complex tends to
become a weakness. The truth of the proposition will here be
shortly manifested.} 12. O-O Nd5 {! He feels himself here as
if at home, for e4 is not possible because of ...Nxd4.}
13. Nxd5 {If 13 Ne4, the result would be the mobilization of
Black's queen side by 13...b5 14 Ne5 Nxe5 15 dxe5 c5 16 a3 c4,
etc.; or 14 Ncd2 e5, etc. and White's game is disorganized.}
Qxd5 {!} 14. Qc2 e5 {White's center is already demolished.}
15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. dxe5 Qxe5 17. Bd2 Bxd2 18. Qxd2 Rfd8 19. Qc2
Rd5 {! He makes use of the point d5 in excellent fashion.}
20. Rad1 Rbd8 21. Rxd5 Rxd5 22. Rd1 g6 23. Rxd5 Qxd5 24. a3 c5
{Black has a decided advantage for the endgame. Pawn majority
on the queen side, the queen file. and last but not least the
central position of his queen. This advantage is, however,
still only a small one.} 25. h3 b5 {Centralization proceeds
apace! White's pawn majority is much less easily realizable
than Black's (if, for instance 26 f3, then 26...f5, and
White's e4 is in bondage), and this is sufficient to explain
the loss of the game.} 26. Qc3 c4 27. f4 Qe4 {!} 28. Kf2 a5
{The whole thing is played by Tartakower with wonderful
precision and truly artistic elegence. Tartakower is, in my
opinion, without question the third best endgame artist of all
living masters.} 29. g4 h6 30. h4 Qh1 {! Only now, and this
tardiness is to his credit, does he give up the central
position in favor of a diversion.} 31. Kg3 Qg1+ 32. Kf3 Qh2
{!} 33. g5 h5 34. Ke4 Qxh4 35. Qxa5 Qh1+ 36. Ke5 Qc6 {! In
order on 37 Qe1 to put in operation the following maneuver:
37...Qc5+ Ke4 Qf5+ followed by ...Qc2 and wins.} 37. Qa7 h4
38. f5 {White is already at his last gasp.} gxf5 39. Kxf5 Qf3+
40. Ke5 h3 41. Kd4 Qg4+ 0-1
