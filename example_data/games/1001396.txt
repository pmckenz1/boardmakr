{Staunton was fond of the double flank development of his
bishop. It is, however, somewhat time-consuming and Horwitz
should now have seized his chance to occupy the center with
10...e5.} Qe8 11. Bb2 Qf7 12. Rc1 Bd7 13. e4 {This central
thrust, all the stronger for being delayed, announces that
White has won the battle of the opening.} fxe4 14. dxe4 Rad8

{An unnecessary weakening of the f6-square from which Staunton
now profits.} 20. Qb3 Bc8 21. Ne4 Bb6 22. Rbd1 Na6 23. Qc3
Rxd1 24. Rxd1 Nc5 25. Nd6 Qc7 26. Qc2 Ng7 27. g4 {The prelude
to the decisive attack, in which Staunton's pieces stream
across to menace the black king. Firstly, Staunton restricts
the possibilities of Black's defensive knight on g7.} Qe7

33. Nf6+ Kh8 34. Qh3 Ne8 35. Ba1 {Staunton's deployment of his
forces creates a wonderfully aesthetic impression, highlighted
by this sweeping retreat of his bishop which is, nevertheless,
still firmly targeted on the black king.} Nxf6 36. exf6 Kg8
37. Be5 Qb7 38. Be4 Qf7 {If Black can blockade the passed pawn
he may survive, but Staunton's next brilliant stroke banishes
such hopes.} 39. Ng1 {A profound retreat. The piece is now
free to manoeuvre via f3 to e5 or g5, thus causing havoc with
the defensive units around the black king.} Bd8 40. g5 Bb7
