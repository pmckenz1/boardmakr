1.d4 {Analysis by Wilhelm Steinitz.} e6 2.e4 b6 3.Bd3 Bb7
4.Nf3 {Not a good post for the Knight in this opening, as it
mostly of great importance to support the K center by f3,
which square is now blocked for that pawn.} g6 5.O-O Bg7 6.c3
h5 {At this point, Black might have utilized White's
objectionable 4th move by 6. ...f5. If 7. exf5 gxf5 with the
superior game. Or if 7. e5 Nh6, again with the better
position. Finally, if 7. Nbd2 Nf6 followed soon by O-O and we
prefer Black's game. The move in the text is weak.} 7.Be3 d6
8.Qc2 Nd7 9.Nbd2 Qe7 10.Rae1 h4 11.h3 Bh6 12.e5 dxe5 13.dxe5
O-O-O 14.Be4 Bxe3 {The adverse attack is greatly strengthened
by this exchange. Nc5 was by far better.} 15.Bxb7+ Kxb7
16.Rxe3 Nh6 17.Qe4+ Ka6 {His game was bad, even if he had made
the best move at his disposal, namely, 17. ...Kc8, whereupon
after 18. Qa8+ Nb8 19. Nd4, White would have won a pawn at
least, with a fine game; but the move in the text is a curious
blunder that confines the King in a mating net.} 18.c4 Nc5 {If
18. ...b5, his only other alternative, 19. Qc6+ followed by
Ra3+ wins easily.} 19.Ra3+ 1-0
