1.e4 {Notes by Steinitz} e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.Bb5 Bb4
5.O-O O-O 6.d3 d6 7.Bxc6 {As usual, such an exchange early in
the opening does not turn out advantageous.} bxc6 8.Ne2 Bg4
9.Ng3 Nh5 {A very good way of playing for the second party,
which we believe was first introduced by Herr Winawer.} 10.h3
Nxg3 11.fxg3 Bd7 {Better than ...Be6 at the present juncture,
though he has to play it to that square later on. His object
is at this stage to guard all points and to provide in advance
against any contingent adverse attack by Qa4 after c3.} 12.g4
Bc5+ 13.Kh1 Rb8 14.Qe1 Kh8 15.c3 {b3 was much better.} a5
{Black conducts the attack on the Q side in true modern
style. Albeit his doubled Pawn, he has the superior game on
account of the strnght of his two Bishops.} 16.Rb1 Qe7 17.Bg5
{Be3 here and on the next move, with the object of getting rid
of the adverse two Bishops, was a moe hopeful plan.} f6 18.Bd2
Be6 19.b3 d5 20.Nh4 Qd7 21.Rd1 a4 22.b4 Bd6 23.a3 dxe4 24.dxe4
Bb3 25.Rb1 Rbd8 {The KR would have been much better placed
here on that square if only for the reason that it provided at
once a retreat of the KB and guarded the valuable Bishop
against being exchanged for the adverse Knight.} 26.Rb2 c5
27.Nf5 cxb4 28.cxb4 Rf7 29.Qe2 {White ought not to have
hesitated to exchange Knight for Bishop, in order to remain
with Bishops of opposite colors, which gave him excellent
drawing prospects.} Bf8 30.Bc3 Qe6 31.Rf2 Rfd7 32.Rd2 Rxd2
33.Bxd2 c5 34.Qb5 Qc4 {This energetic move decides the battle,
for after the exchange of Queens which is forced, as Black
threatens Rxd2 followed by Qf1+; Black has an easy task, as he
forms a far advanced Pawn and ultimately wins one of his
opponent's.} 35.Qxc4 Bxc4 36.Bc3 cxb4 37.axb4 a3 38.Rd2 Rxd2
39.Bxd2 a2 40.Bc3 Bxb4 41.Bb2 Bc5 42.g5 Be6 {Promptly foring
the entrance of his Bd4, which wins a piece.} 43.gxf6 gxf6
44.g4 Bxf5 45.g5 Bxe4+ 46.Kh2 Bd4 0-1
