1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 d5 4. Bg2 dxc4
5. Qa4+ Bd7 6. Qxc4 Bc6 7. Nf3 Bd5 {Black loses too many tempi
with these bishop moves. Better is 7...Nbd7 and if 8 Nc3 then
8...Nb6 9 Qd3 Bb4, as it was played in the game Junge-Alekhine
in the same tournament.} 8. Qd3 c5 9. Nc3 Bc6 {If 9...cxd4
there would follow 10 Nxd5 Qxd5 11 O-O with the strong threat
of 12 Nxd4.}10. O-O Nbd7 11. Rd1 cxd4 {If 11...Be7 then 12 e4
and White with the threat of 13 d5, would practically force
the exchange at d4, which would guarantee him the advantage of
the bishop pair.} 12. Nxd4 Bxg2 13. Kxg2 Be7 14. Qf3 {The
queen now exerts strong pressure on the enemy queen's side.}
Qb6 {this move will be refuted by energetic combinative
play. but 14...Qb8 15 Nb3 with the threat of 16 Bf4 would be
equally unsatisfactory.} 15. Be3 {! The consequences of this
move are not very difficult to calculate, but it is
interesting to prove that from this moment onwards Black
already lacks any satisfactory defence. Against 15 Qxb2 White
replies 16 Ncb5 and if 15...Ne5 there would follow 16 Ndb5!}
O-O 16. Nf5 Bc5 {This apparent salvation will be refuted by a
well-concealed combination. Nor would the alternative 16...Qd8
17 Nxe7+ Qxe7 18 Qxb7 Rfb8 19 Qc7 Rxb2 20 Bd4 have saved the
game.} 17. Na4 Qa5 18. Nxc5 Nxc5 19. Nxg7 {! This wins at
least a pawn and leads to a simply won ending. The only reply
- excluding the text - would be 19...Nce4, against which White
would first have forced the black queen to abandon the fifth
rank and would then have occupied the long diagonal with the
bishop, with decisive effect: 20 b4! Qe5 21 Bf4 Qb5 (or
21...Qc3 22 Nh5!!) 22 a4! Qxb4 23 Be5 etc.} Kxg7 20. Bd4 {The
strength of this move lies mainly in the fact that after
20...Nd7 White simply plays 21 Bc3, with the unavoidable
threat of 22 Rxd7.} Ne4 21. Qxe4 Qf5 {The endgame that follows
is without any technical difficulties.} 22. Qxf5 exf5 23. Rac1
Rfe8 24. Rc7 Rxe2 25. Rxb7 Kg6 26. Bxf6 Kxf6 27. Rd6+ {If
27...Kg7 there follows 28 Rdd7 Rf8 29 Kf3 Rc2 30 Rdc7 Rd2 31
Ke3.} 1-0
